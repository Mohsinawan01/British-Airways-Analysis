# Web Scraping:
    We begin by collecting customer reviews from a reliable source using web scraping techniques. The scraped data will serve as the foundation of our analysis.
# Data Preprocessing:
    The collected data undergoes preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. This involves removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and standardizing the format of the reviews.

    Drawing insights from our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and address identified issues. These recommendations can help British Airways enhance their services and customer experience.
# Conclusion:
    In conclusion, our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of customer sentiments towards British Airways. We highlight the key findings, major themes, and areas of improvement, which can be valuable for the airline in making informed decisions.
