       "[\"| A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.\",\n",
       " '|  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the \"chocolate and orange pot\" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can\\'t afford it?',\n",
       " \"|  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  I\\'m sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the \"free water\" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc.',\n",
       " '|  Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!',\n",
       " '| Another really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can’t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified | Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.\",\n",
       " '|  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.',\n",
       " \"|  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again!\",\n",
       " '|  In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket ‘did not exist’. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct. I do not intend to let this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund. PS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is short-changing passengers.',\n",
       " \"|  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom. If they can do it, then why not British Airways.\",\n",
       " '|  We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn’t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t understand why BA don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problem. Shocking customer service!',\n",
       " '|  Original flight was cancelled with no explanation. There was no representative to help in rebooking We had to call customer service (long distance call) The line kept dropping Had to do 40 + calls to find new booking only to discover the only way I could fly the next day was by paying business class. No help with hotel for the night stay.',\n",

However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft.

We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.\",\n",

We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits.

This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don\\'t fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of \"supply issues\".

They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement.

Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.',\n",

Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips.

I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money',\n",
       " \"|  Words fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight LHR/SFO, it's understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound). The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - poor BA is on the skids downhill.\",\n",
       " '|  Absolutely terrible experience. The app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when provided. I was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. This was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limited. I was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport.',\n",
       " \"| BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer. It means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage. Makes easyJet and Ryanair look like customer champions. The server in Itsu in the BA terminal says she stopped flying BA years ago due to the service being bad all the time. Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.\",\n",
       " \"|  \\r\\nThe flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified | Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more.',\n",
       " \"| I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great.\",\n",
       " \"|  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me. I've lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show.\",\n",
       " '|  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.',\n",

The airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices.',\n",
       " '|  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service.',\n",

Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel.

Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.',\n",
       " '|  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.',\n",
       " \"|  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was\\xa0the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping.\",\n",

It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around\",\n",

The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.\",\n",

There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there.

There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through.

Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam?

They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360.

Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them.

The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on.

Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone.

       " \"|  \\r\\nOur flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.\",\n",

Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button.

       " '|  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.',\n",

We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

       " '|  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.',\n",

Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I\\'m 6\\'4\" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional. In flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced, I enjoyed the Meat Ploughman\\'s and IPA beer (€10 -/+ total) on both flights I have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one LGW-LHR helicopter transfer. Flying was a totally different experience \\'back in the day\\', we are now in the age of the \\'budget airline\\' Nostalgia aside.. British Airways are the best airline I\\'ve flown with.',\n",

Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid. Without the support of the lovely Althea, her professionalism, her care for us, we would not have make it. She was so sweet, so caring, but at the same time so determined to help, she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities.\",\n",

       " \"|  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.\",\n",

I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice. \\xa0 I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.',\n",

On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).',\n",

I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones.

       " '|  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days.

       " '| Probably the worst business class experience I\\'ve ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to \"upload my COVID documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any \"COVID documentation\" - I was informed (several hours later) that my \"COVID documents have been verified\". I then received another text message urging me to \"upload my COVID documentation\". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the \"chicken or fish?\" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a \"ploughman\\'s lunch\" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won\\'t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6\\' 2\" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6\\' 2\" height. The \"Priority\" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.',\n",

The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen.',\n",

Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips.',\n",

Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think.

IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

       " '|  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. We will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future.',\n",

I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night.

       " '|  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there.',\n",

I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good.\",\n",

Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).

My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there.

No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits.

I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA.\",\n",

Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later).

The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey.',\n",

I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty.

Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing.

The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.',\n",

Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered.

On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken.

We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly.',\n",
       " '| The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.',\n",
       " \"| This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class.\",\n",
       " '|  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.',\n",

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service.

I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when.

It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed.

I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA.\",\n",

       " '|  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.

Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.',\n",

The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight.',\n",

They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped.

I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn\\'t find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I\\'d get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn\\'t fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn\\'t get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn\\'t getting a full refund. I didn\\'t cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. \"Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We\\'re sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim\\'s been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations\".

At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales.

Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines.

Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew\",\n",

Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing.',\n",
       " \"|  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.\",\n",

Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the\\xa0Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages\\xa0(I flew Turkish 10 days ago).

The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone).

However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?\",\n",

A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. The solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service.

The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage.

It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget.

Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.\",\n",

At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket.

The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train.

I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available.

I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated.',\n",

       " '|  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after \"needing\" to put me on hold once more to \"speak with their supervisor.\" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the \"leftovers\", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn\\'t realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect.',\n",

The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit.',\n",

There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket.

However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.',\n",

To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed.

Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.\",\n",

Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again.',\n",

We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the \"Points game\" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal.

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.

On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.\",\n",

I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved.

Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. If I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA.',\n",

The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again.',\n",

But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched.

I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.\",\n",

Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato!

The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight.

Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.\",\n",

Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley.

This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned.

You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight.

The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient.

The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule.

The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff.

Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying.

       " 'Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!',\n",

Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew',\n",

My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to \"Club check-in\" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!',\n",
       " '|  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!',\n",

Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.',\n",

Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards.',\n",

The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids.

Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport.',\n",
       " \"|  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.\",\n",
       " \"| After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!\",\n",
       " '|  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I\\'d be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I\\'d be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I\\'d be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn\\'t add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with \"That\\'s the final amount.\" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they\\'ve yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me.',\n",
       " '| Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze.',\n",
       " '|  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that.',\n",
       " '|  Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed.',\n",
       " '|  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA.',\n",
       " '|  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame.',\n",
       " \"|  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times.\",\n",
       " '|  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day.',\n",
       " \"|  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible.\",\n",

I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service.\",\n",

       " \"|  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.\",\n",
       " '|  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated.',\n",
       " '|  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.',\n",

For me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. I was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. Landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. Not BA's finest hour.\",\n",

Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front.

On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined).

We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue.

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option.',\n",

The flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British Airways. I cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much.',\n",

When I requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started, I was told that tea would be served after dinner. I did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened. At dinner, there was no tea service. I did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea.  There was no hand soap in the washroom. However, on my way to London from Toronto, my experience was a good one. However, it was not the same on my return flight.',\n",

The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off. Apparently this is a long running scam, I don’t know how they get away with it.',\n",

They cannot provide the service I paid for and refuse to refund me. They are not sympathetic or understanding.

Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. The cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers.',\n",

Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly.

However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.

The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.

Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch.

We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment.

However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service.

I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says \"therefore we can\\'t answer your call; try again.\" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I\\'ve now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor\\'s note saying that I was sick, then they\\'ll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation.',\n",

Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience.',\n",
       " '| Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around.',\n",

You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone.

After flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life! I tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time I didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff.',\n",

The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier.

I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me.

So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.',\n",

The seats were BA\\'s universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm\\'s length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn\\'t available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The \"bed\" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I\\'ve ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

There was a big mix up which I find inexcusable - I and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but I don't expect such at this level. Bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome. The plane arrived 10 minutes late.\",\n",

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care.\",\n",

My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant.

But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in',\n",

Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them.

I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.\",\n",

Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge.

It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck.

The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so.

BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them.

       " \"|  London-Heathrow to Warsaw on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaning. Very friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure time. What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet. Whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy.\",\n",
       " '| Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. Lessons learned, avoid if you can.',\n",

They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. The calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes.  BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructive. Furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time BA should be able to do the same.

They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that \"all journeys complete\". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren\\'t accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client\\'s data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than BA).',\n",

Three days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. I spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went unanswered. On the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line. When this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected. Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company. But two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn’t do this because I had bought a package and that this could only be done by BA.

The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable.

How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us.',\n",

The stewards dealt with this situation with tact, absolute professionalism and great courtesy. All the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment.

I know the airline is suffering, like the rest of UK industry and business, but how can they get away with such deceitful practices.

Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant.

       " \"|  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.\",\n",
       " '|  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.',\n",

The SLOW lounge at Cape Town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink, including ingenious wine-dispensing machines.

Thanks to the kind strangers I managed to get to the Danish embassy and get a temporary passport. When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. When I finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as I haven't had any food for the whole day as I didn't have any money. I want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that I got back to Denmark safely. I was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff! Once again thank you!\",\n",

If you choose your seat in Club World carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations. The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. On this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good. Departed PHX early and arrived into LHR early where immigration and baggage took minutes. If you manage your expectations with BA, then you won't be disappointed with Club World.\",\n",

However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern. British Airways needs to improve their ground experience.\",\n",

       " '|  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31\". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific\\'s is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I\\'d fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.',\n",

The cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch. I would not hesitate flying First class with BA on my next flight.',\n",

However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage.',\n",

Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.\",\n",

       " 'Not Verified |  London to Los Angeles. Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  British Airways (Comair) Johannesburg to Cape Town route is never less than fully subscribed, and on this occasion the equivalent of Club Europe stretched back 9 rows. Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, I.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. The hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges. Comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering.

My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together.

       " '|  Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.  BA  need to refurbish their old cabins on Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747,if they still plan to use them on longer flights.',\n",

The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience.

I settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. Crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately.

       " '|  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos. They offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.',\n",

Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA.

The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing.

When I got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and I can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly.

The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown.

I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. I wrote in to British Airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respond. Awful, rude airline.\",\n",

       " \"|  Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product.\",\n",

Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6\\'1\" makes the beds small. And since it\\'s so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful. Meals are impeccable.',\n",

       " 'Not Verified | London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable. We had exit row seating for entire flight which I recommend to anyone over 6ft tall.',\n",
       " '| London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA\\'s 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service \"business class\"? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again.',\n",
       " \"|  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.\",\n",
       " '|  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go. I hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight.',\n",

       " 'Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time. Overall, a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average.',\n",

To have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult.

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. On other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings.',\n",

       " '| Sydney to Singapore with British Airways. Packed in like sardines in a tin can. What a disappointment of an airline. They pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. You awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze. My seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways). Would not and could not recommended this airline. These seats are at best premium economy.',\n",
       " '| London to Mauritius. We are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline.',\n",

       " '|  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul.',\n",
       " '| The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a \"mix up\" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a \"mix up\" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline.',\n",

I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so.',\n",

I'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. It's not worth it.\",\n",

       " '| London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update! In summary, don’t trust BA with your loved ones care.',\n",
       " '|  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.',\n",

The tray on the 12D where I was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the TV screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch. Although my husband in 12E and me turned in the breakfast cards together, the flight attendant insisted they don’t have it, and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast.

       " '|  Kuala Lumpur to Glasgow via London. The service started, first some drinks. On my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant.  I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager. The female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that. ABreakfast I was offered tea or coffee (even decaf), I accepted, but there was no milk or cream for me.',\n",

Food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals, my beef was well done just how I like it.

After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand. It ended up costing my wife and I almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and British Airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher. We will never use this airline again.',\n",

Flew Aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided.\",\n",

If the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. Shameful. The food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food. I will never fly British Airways again. 0 stars. Beware. I should only add that the NYC JFK and London waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam. Horrible excuse for an airline.',\n",

My Ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. Before taking off in Buenos Aires, some pax, but not all, were offered water or orange juice. I never got any. After take off, drinks were offered, followed by a hot meal. Food choices ran out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammed. On the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew OK. No indication as to which toilets to use, either forward in business class or rear economy.

Not very tasty. The breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fruit and a muffin, it was delicious! The cabin crew was ok. Not bad, not excellent. We arrived on time and was a great flight. On the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice. No IFE, no onboard service. It’s almost like a low cost. I recommend for long flights, but not for European flights.',\n",

Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our \"no show\" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.',\n",
       " '| Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new \"business suite\" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don\\'t know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.',\n",

When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so.

A praise is due and I want to congratulate BA for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed, the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content, the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler.

Would I choose BA premium Eco again : Yes Definitely.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified | I wish I could give a zero. I was booked on a flight from Newark to Madrid via London. I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something. I will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as well. Be warned. Stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise.',\n",

On my return flight (26 Sept) it was a different matter. From entering Alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the VIP lounge which was good). Travelling Club Europe had no advantages. Only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to print boarding passes. When invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane. The Iberia factor. Honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company.

       " 'Not Verified | We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify! It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicest possible way. Get yourselves down to good ole Austin now that BA fly there direct. Fantastic.',\n",

We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockers. But plenty of spare lockers and our iPads took are of that.',\n",

I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund.',\n",
       " \"| The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.\",\n",

During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm.

       " \"| Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.\",\n",

Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way.

       " '|  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.',\n",

Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. The night term pantry offering was a total joke. I have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service level.

Flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled. Breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow.

Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320-232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew. Will be flying with BA again in December (strikes permitting). Still recommended by me as the National Carrier.',\n",

Was met by a rude lady at First class check in and the process took about 20 minutes, don’t know why, no apology. The boarding was in time. The welcome wasn’t especially friendly, just pointing the direction where to go. The club Europe cabin felt claustrophobic, I had a window seat. The CSM never came to say hello. The service was pretty basic, ok during the meals but self service between. No drink service if you didn’t ask. On the flight to Stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members. The service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly. The seating was terrible on this A320, so tight.',\n",
       " '|  Glasgow to Tampa via Gatwick. Early morning flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Flight dud take off at 6.45. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug did not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy, smooth flight down. Gatwick to Tampa, according to manage my booking, aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure. At boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World, a very pleasant surprise. If was on 777 which had not been refurbished, extra space was very good, staff were very efficient and pleasant. Only downside was the main meal, which I would have had in original seats, but main courses were not to my liking, but afternoon tea was very good. So thank you BA for the experience.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. Travelling home was extremely disappointing. The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made. The standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service.',\n",
       " '|  London to Abu Dhabi. This is the daytime flight from London. A very good flight. The food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service). The children’s meals were excellent. The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew were good. Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. Good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad.',\n",
       " '|  London to St Petersburgh. Huge disappointment for BA business class service in European routes. Seat pitch has been reduced to 30\" over the last years (from 34\") at the expense of passenger comfort. Seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat. Food for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungry. Out of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option. Avoid Club Europe, not worth the money.',\n",
       " \"|  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.\",\n",
       " '| I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. This might be a British trait as I’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience.',\n",

I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard.

A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.',\n",

When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. I have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. British Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided.',\n",

They erroneously cancelled my seats although I had checked in over 5 hours before he flight. They then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage for 15 days. These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. If you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They do not. You can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages. Do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you.\",\n",

But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.',\n",

My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$.

       " \"|  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.\",\n",

I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing.

Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided.

Then I had to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours. There was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us. Now it was 3am with no one to speak too and I still don't have my bags. I had to grab a taxi to sleep (BA didn't not provide a hotel stay). I I then had to leave the apartment at 7 am to get to the next flight with Kuwait Airways.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow. My wife and I flew back from Argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess (Amelia) who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner. On finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card. The trip itself left on time and arrived in London early. The aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable. The entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen .',\n",
       " '|  Hong Kong to London Heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by Boeing 777-300ER. The seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. The legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat. This negatively affects the legroom. The films provided are not that many but I can see the flight path through the personal television. They provide dinner and breakfast for me. It is quite abundant but not very delicious.',\n",
       " '|  What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation. I must state staff on plane very good.',\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to Malaga in business class. Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.',\n",

The 777 aircraft is looking old, the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped, the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens (films are OK, the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OK. The flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time (allowing for the rerouting around Pakistani airspace).',\n",

The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart. I rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. Its a pity i didn't get their names i was panicky. Thank you so much!\",\n",

       " \"| Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.\",\n",
       " \"|  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.\",\n",
       " '|  Prague to London. A two hour flight on 27th July was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by BA.

       " \"|  London to Dubai. Lately I am frequently flying Premium Economy with British Airways. The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleled. The seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendly. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old BA Premium Economy seats), then it would be perfect. That's my only note.\",\n",
       " \"|  Tel Aviv to Toronto via London. The plane from London to Toronto was run by Air Belgium The service from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellent. The cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly. The food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. Soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights. I haven't travelled British Airways for years but I will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights\",\n",
       " '|  I flew yesterday from Heathrow to Manchester in business class, from start to finish it was a shambles.  I was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, I showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate. The boarding process was more like a rugby scrum, no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this.',\n",
       " '|  The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in London the problems started. The gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks.',\n",

       " \"| Seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight. No drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offered. No amenity kits. When I asked, they said none were left in stock. They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!\",\n",
       " '| Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. But that really shouldn’t happen. What is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered TSA line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it.',\n",

(See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. Ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. Feel totally ripped off.',\n",

We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures.

As I worried I wouldn’t make it, I asked to be put in a hotel & fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked. There was no apology, no offer of a bus or taxis to those re-routed to Amsterdam. And throughout the process & long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening. Had I known we’d be re-routed to Amsterdam I would’ve left Rotterdam earlier, rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end. What a waste of time, energy & money.

Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I have ever been on.',\n",

I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing.',\n",

On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. She came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! To say I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and you certainly made it something special!',\n",

Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA. Perhaps standards at LGW are not as good as at LHR.',\n",

Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time.

I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music.

Given the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  London to Vancouver. Economy was a lot more cramped than I expected. BA had crammed seats in. Crew were okay. Food reasonable really although I had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame. Flew back premium class, more room. I probably won’t use them in November when I go back. Timing was good and air quality felt ok as I didn’t get a headache.',\n",
       " '❎ Not Verified | Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. I paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking.',\n",
       " '|  Miami to Delhi via London.  The BA business class I flew for the first time recently was the worst I have  flown. Whereas most have four seats across British Airways has eight! The lay down beds are hard, thin and short. Not worth the money.',\n",

       " \"|  Standard, run of the mill airline for today's economy. Flew Tel Aviv to New York, with a two hour layover in London Heathrow. Crew was fine, entertainment system on the London to New York leg was very nice. The special meal I ordered was not on either of the two flights. I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. I submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses I received were lame and unacceptable. Not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500).\",\n",
       " '|  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn\\'t an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we\\'re used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta\\'s. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the \"tea\" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.',\n",
       " '|  Buenos Aires to London. I wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while I was terribly sick. Wish I knew their names! They gave me medicine, a blanket and caressed my back while I was crying from the stomach ache. Forever grateful.',\n",
       " '|  London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. British Airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. This is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow.',\n",
       " '|  Flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only Boeing 747-400 that was in old BOAC retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the IFE was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness!',\n",
       " '| Just checked in for a flight from Newcastle with BA. The check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The “welcome” sign displayed at the BA desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. To cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!',\n",
       " '|  Gatwick to Madrid. When I arrived I waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase. It didn’t arrive.  I was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which I did and given a number to call the next day. The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours before I left Madrid. So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that I needed whilst there.',\n",
       " '|  My boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight.',\n",
       " \"|  I had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin. Somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn't fit the bag in the space remaining, so they kept the bag on my laptop bag. When I asked the flight attendant to help me with this, he asked me to keep my luggage down.  I was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out. How fair is this?\",\n",
       " '|  London to Delhi. A truly first class experience from check in to landing. I am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience, this one was. Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved.',\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to Dubai. Last Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with Emirates. Today we arrived at Dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. We have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  London to Seattle. My husband and I have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in America. We have always been very satisfied with the service. Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park. We met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how I was. Many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that I must have disturbed.',\n",
       " '|  Johannesburg to London. I booked a seat without luggage. Firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. This caused an issue when trying to seat together. When the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. This was not disclosed when the booking was made. It was irritating because one of us was ill.',\n",
       " \"|  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.\",\n",
       " '|  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.',\n",
       " '| London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls.',\n",
       " \"| CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.\",\n",
       " '|  Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again.',\n",
       " '|  Lima to Gatwick. Helpful and courteous cabin crew.  The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. The screen was small and in poor condition. Movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor. The touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset. A 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system.',\n",
       " '| Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights.',\n",
       " '| I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight.',\n",
       " \"|  Flight was OK, minor delay didn't both me. What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time?

       " \"|  \\r\\nGatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor.\",\n",
       " '|  Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. I believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a BA flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me.',\n",

       " '|  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.',\n",
       " '|  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher.',\n",
       " \"|  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.\",\n",
       " \"|  This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on.\",\n",

I was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the Boarding Gate. I saw people boarding with Tax free bags on top of the other bags. Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. I was not happy because I had the permitted allowance.',\n",

I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. I would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from Premium. I felt a complete waste of £500.',\n",

Paid for and travelling Business Class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure.

This is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to look at BA.',\n",
       " \"| Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.\",\n",

       " '|  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough.',\n",

We fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. I spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. It was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it\\'s now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. One customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to \"pick them up.\" Truly the worst customer experience I\\'ve had.',\n",

Seats much smaller than business class on Singapore Air, Thai International, Eva Air, Qantas; Not seated together - same surname, Mr and Mrs - but moved after. No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. I would never choose to travel BA again.',\n",
       " \"|  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.\",\n",

The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. Rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!\",\n",

The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.',\n",

Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act. I certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future.',\n",

Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough.

The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage.',\n",

Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful.',\n",

Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing.\",\n",

When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly.',\n",

Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.',\n",

Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?',\n",
       " '|  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.',\n",

Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this.',\n",

Heathrow T5 the usual chaos. I can use the F Lounge due to my One World status. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Toilets filthy. One of the worst lounges I’ve seen. Boarding orderly and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE screen broken. Seats very uncomfortable and narrow. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful. Overall a rather disappointing experience. BA cannot compete with the Middle Eastern carriers.',\n",

Following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with BA despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor, I quickly called up BA to resolve the issue. They understood the problem and gave me a full refund. The agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem. I don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see BA treat their customers with care.',\n",
       " '|  Doha to Paris via London. This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class.',\n",

When I complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 K miles. The bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones. The angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest. Video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing. Cabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call button. In flight entertainment is poor.',\n",

Three times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive.',\n",

The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again.',\n",
       " \"|  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.\",\n",
       " '| Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, \"we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us\". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a \"balance problem\". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me.',\n",
       " '|  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the \"turn right\" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service.',\n",

The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation.

Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.\",\n",
       " \"|  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?\",\n",
       " '| \\r\\nLondon Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman\\'s lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that\\'s the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I\\'d make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6\" of leg room behind row \"1\". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i\\'d probably sell it at £25 a flight more. \"Build value guys\" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.',\n",
       " '| Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.',\n",
       " '|  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Flew out of Heathrow on 22nd Feb to New York, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour. The reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were. The crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to all involved on that flight.\",\n",
       " '|  Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5\\'2\" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me.',\n",
       " '|  New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so I’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again.',\n",
       " \"|  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers.\",\n",
       " \"|  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment.\",\n",
       " '|  Prague to London Heathrow. Very disappointing service. Cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley. On the bright said, I did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices.',\n",
       " '|  London City to Florence. My flight was at around 7am in the morning. Not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking. On their site I had the option to reschedule my flight but I couldn’t select any flights on the same day. Interestingly i was able to find & book another one through Skyscanner again with BA at the day of my initial flight with £100 more, of course. Why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page?',\n",
       " '|  London to Johannesburg. Since the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flight. We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained.',\n",
       " '|  Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand.',\n",

Now on February 2019 calling British Airways to redeem my Avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agent. She explained everything in such detail. You are doing great with such fantastic employees.',\n",
       " \"|  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.\",\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought this was a good flight.',\n",
       " \"| San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline.\",\n",

Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying \"I\\'d like to know you that we are unable to offer refund\". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.',\n",
       " '|  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option.',\n",
       " \"|  Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller.\",\n",

Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. Then flight does not have enough food onboard. At least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum.',\n",
       " '|  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.',\n",

       " \"|  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.\",\n",
       " \"|  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.\",\n",

Upon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful.

On long flights like this I always reserve an aisle seat. Online Check-in did not work, no reason was given. Ok, let’s call US hotline. I tried at least 40 times. Answers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now. I did not make it through. As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So I‘ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers.

I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection.

I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration.

I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double.

Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. This was really poor service.

Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but not first class.\",\n",

The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

The main course was beef ratatouille with a Do&Co dessert pot. This was the best inflight meal I've had on a short haul flight.

It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I'm glad I didn't. My frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too.\",\n",

The flight entertainment system are outdated. I am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection.

But the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I enjoyed the flight. The seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. Like how the taxi from Polderban is almost as long as the flight itself.',\n",
       " \"|  Antigua to Gatwick. Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. Tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. When asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue.\",\n",

I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15\". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must\\'ve been. And of course you only get compensation by patronising them again. Now I know: ever a free ticket on BOAC is overpriced.',\n",

The toilets are dirty and basic. I’m a Gold Member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines. They’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap.',\n",

Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. Not my best flight.',\n",

The movie selection was OK. The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. The 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies.',\n",

Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. Insufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy.\",\n",

It took me nearly 24 hours to travel from Barcelona to JFK.  When I arrived, my luggage wasn't there so I filed a claim. I called and emailed every day and they couldn't find it even though I had a tag number and and documentation.

I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded.

       " \"|  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.\",\n",

My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).',\n",

This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects of BA's service in the past, I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements.\",\n",

We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class.',\n",
       " \"| I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.',\n",

BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast. That flight was a total disappointment.',\n",

I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

       " '|  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I\\'d guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the \"new\" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It\\'s probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being \"an up market business class\" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you\\'d expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the \"cheap\" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the \"superb\" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world\\'s most hated Business Class in the sky. I\\'m a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.',\n",

The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I've had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it.

He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.',\n",
       " '|  Bridgetown to Gatwick. Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at £1,000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told \"We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that\". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. If you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.',\n",
       " \"|  Glasgow to New York via London. Morning flight from GLA to LHR was ok. I really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFK. On the JFK flight the service was fantastic. The meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. We left and arrived on time. The seat and legroom was fine. My mothers IFE didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. The cabin crew were very friendly.\",\n",
       " '|  Sydney to London via Singapore. I\\'m hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you\\'re interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you\\'re next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The \"new releases\" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. I would not recommend BA to anyone.',\n",
       " '|  Johannesburg to London. In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. The cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight.',\n",
       " \"|  Antigua to Gatwick. One of the worst business class experience. Entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. Food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. Nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. Woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt.\",\n",
       " \"|  Gatwick to Barbados. First class was third rate. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. Poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. I have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember why. Avoid them if your route allows.\",\n",
       " \"|  Cape Town to London. Very unimpressive amenities and service. Unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course. I finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.\",\n",
       " \"|  Bucharest to London. They are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haul. In Bucharest they did not park at the terminal, they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus. They are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. Avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to. I have no problem with BA turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we're being scammed.\",\n",
       " '| Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City via London. The journey from Malaysia to Mexico alone for business trip would be very boring. However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on food. They are polite and talk to me with big smiles. So, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them again. Hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip.',\n",
       " '|  Miami to London. BA are going downhill . Having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey, the choice was exactly the same this time.  I explained to the steward that I didn’t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but I was told by an extremely rude steward that I could like it or lump it basically. He said I should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  The snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. Totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. The light didn’t work on my seat so I couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my TV, watching was incredibly hard. Entertainment having travelled four times in last month, films have barely changed. I won’t be travelling with them again if at all possible.',\n",
       " '| \\r\\nI would like to compliment British Airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food served. Before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company. Overall a very enjoyable flight from London Gatwick to Tampa.',\n",
       " \"| Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. This airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements BA's transformation into an overpriced EasyJet. Will not fly with them again.\",\n",
       " '|  We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girl. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future.',\n",
       " '|  Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days. All in all a very enjoyable flight.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better.',\n",
       " '|  Phoenix to Accra via London. I had a great Customer service treatment at the check in at Phoenix by the young lady who checked me in. She was very professional and handled my check in process excellently. My entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as well. Just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.',\n",
       " '|  Manchester to London. The bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked in already. The staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British, and I’ll certainly not be recommending!',\n",
       " \"|  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service.\",\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult. The bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.',\n",
       " \"|  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.\",\n",
       " '|  Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. I rejected BA\\'s offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. When I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to sit separately. At the booking in I was told that they could not find \"proof\" that I had paid for selected seats. I could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. Spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I planned. On the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my TV did not work. The staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat. On return, BA customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. Despite sending two detailed messages, I received the same response. Completely inadequate service by BA (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights I paid for and dealing with the complaints.',\n",
       " \"|  Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. All the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, I'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.\",\n",
       " \"|  Boston to Nairobi via London. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew service was below standard. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movie. I  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungry. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. It looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB port. Cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. I'm probably to blame because I overrated BA before flying with them but now I know better.\",\n",
       " \"|  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I'm off to the US I will look for an alternative airline.\",\n",

Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. Then the customer service has been very useless. Such a very bad experience. I do not recommend flying with them.',\n",

I’m sure it’s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day.',\n",

The plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish.

It was not possible to charge electronic equipment, the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment.',\n",

During check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag.',\n",
       " \"| I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. Don't bother flying BA.\",\n",

On the aircraft, there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7F.  A funny safety video played and the flight was smooth. No food was served, except some M&S, BBC news was playing on the screens, with no sound and Russian captions, quite confusing. The plane landed half an hour late, but it was the best landing I have ever experienced.',\n",
       " '| London to Bangkok. I am not a fan if the BA configuration in Business. However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations.',\n",

Internet available at three times Emirates price and twice AA flight and speed that won’t achieve streaming.

My long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended.',\n",

The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew!',\n",
       " '|  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers.',\n",

You have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights. The departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected. We also parked at a gate at the very far end of T5. The plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us. Service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again. When traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters.',\n",

Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional.

First days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials. Flight home from LHR-YYZ was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn't stay upright.

The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. I don't expect top food in a plane but I expect service. If you announce things, make sure you have them. On some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  You must eat when they order you to eat. They seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon's. You have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner. Entertainment, make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view. BA offers you the most limited offer.\",\n",
       " \"|  Singapore to London Heathrow. It's my first time traveling on British Airways. The seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. So you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). There are 8 Club World seats per row for 777-300ER, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as good as expected. However, I saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night. There could be some other choices.\",\n",
       " \"|  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today's business market.\",\n",
       " \"|  Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. I now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified | London Heathrow to Milan Malpensa. Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. I fly 100+ times a year. British Airways lost my and my wife’s luggage on our vacation. They have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue. They have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us. Please, never book this airline.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways. Like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support.\",\n",
       " '|  London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice.',\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to Miami. The airport staff was very helpful, the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious. I had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well. Overall it was one of the best flights I had.',\n",
       " \"|  London to Singapore. It was a wonderful flight.  I was lucky having a 2-seats-row for my own on the upperdeck, but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect. The crew was very friendly and the food was the best I've had on an airplane. If you fly the A380 in economy, book seats in the upperdeck. Best seats on the plane: 83A or 83K.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified | Dublin to London. I was trying to add additional bag online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct, but I was giving completely correct email address. When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price. Afterwards I phoned customer care to discuss the issue, customer care agent has dropped my call three times. On fourth time I was talking one of the customer care agent. He was not helpful at all, then I asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager, they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy. This is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy. British Airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage. British Airways was always my first priority. Unfortunately, I won’t be flying again with British Airways due to this awkward behavior.',\n",
       " '| London - Pisa (Return). I fly this route often as we have a house in Tuscany. This, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. Outbound we went through the \"First\" wing check in at T5. (We are Gold card members). The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom. BA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business class. The product is only worth it in a Sale or Avious points. The every day fare price is ludicrous.',\n",
       " \"|  I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never fly British Airways again.\",\n",
       " '| \\r\\nBA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.',\n",
       " '| We flew from Los Angeles to Leeds Bradford via Heathrow on Thursday 13th September with British Airways and codeshare partner American Airways. We arrived safely but our bags did not. It is now Monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bags. Come on BA sort this shambles out.',\n",
       " \"|  Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.\",\n",
       " '|  Chicago to London. I have flown long haul many times with both BA and Virgin premium economy. In my view whilst the Virgin product has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly better. Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. For the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off. Plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg.',\n",
       " '|  Berlin to London. It was a connecting flight, so I should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine clean and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffee. While this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers. BA simply turned into a low cost airline.',\n",
       " '|  British Airways is my favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The staff was professional. Food was above expectation. During 7 hours flight staff is always there. Captain kept updating us about weather, turbulence, and time.',\n",
       " \"|  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector.\",\n",
       " '|  London Heathrow to New York JFK. The First Wing at Terminal 5 was rubbish tonight, 20 or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of BA’s ground operation. Flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at Kennedy made us overall late. Staff very cheerful. This route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the Indian chicken was very bland.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first. Whether i would choose it over Club World would be on flight by flight basis. You have to do it once though!\",\n",
       " '|  Heraklion to Gatwick. Left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake. 30 mins after I realised I went back to the airport but no British Airways staff was willing to help. Asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar. Dialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again. This is so frustrating.',\n",

      "Assigned Topics for the First Few Reviews:\n",
      "Review 1: | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.\n",

      "Review 2: |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time.\n",
      "Assigned Topic: Topic 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 3: Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the \"chocolate and orange pot\" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?\n",
      "Assigned Topic: Topic 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 4: |  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience.\n",
      "Assigned Topic: Topic 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Review 5: Not Verified |  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the \"free water\" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc.\n",

      "Review 1: | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.\n",
      "Review 2: |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time.\n",
      "Review 3: Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the \"chocolate and orange pot\" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?\n",
      "Review 4: |  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience.\n",
      "Review 5: Not Verified |  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the \"free water\" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc.\n",

      "Negative Reviews:\n",
      "Review 1: Not Verified | Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.\n",
      "Review 2: |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again!\n",
      "Review 3: |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom. If they can do it, then why not British Airways.\n",
      "Review 4: |  We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn’t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t understand why BA don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problem. Shocking customer service!\n",
      "Review 5: |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. When attempting to collect my luggage, mine was the only one not to arrive. I sought help and was informed to make a claim online. When my bag finally arrived 7 days later, the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. Someone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about, I felt violated. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. For a month, I have been back and forth to British Airways, yet they stated it is not their fault.\n"

      "He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the \"chocolate and orange pot\" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets! All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. |  We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! |  Original flight was cancelled with no explanation. |  Flight fine. |  Came from Glasgow to London and took connecting flight American Airlines from London to North Carolina. They didn't even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight. |  My flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. ggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. My Luggage arrived at LHR as planned on Saturday 6/24. However, upon arrival due to the luggage being mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to Cairo. Its sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it. |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. My meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine. |  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. But on my flight, there was none because of \"supply issues\". So great flight but stick with economy. | Absolutely horrible airline. Last minute delays, cancellations, seat changes with no communication. App and website user experience is years behind other airlines. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. But I didn’t see the day change! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Your flight is not going to work for me. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! The customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flights. Tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight. I thought i was flying Iberia once I looked close at ticket it was British Airways. |  Most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. | An excellent flight in Club World on British Airways. This flight showed that BA can be among the world’s best airlines. After boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes. My first flight with my two kids from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in me missing my connecting flight. Unfortunately, even that flight was delayed. Bag was destroyed, flight delayed 3 hours and couldn't get water on board. Thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until I returned back home. experience but the crew of British Airways made it way more tolerable. |  I haven't flown British Airways before and will never fly them again! When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Entertainment good. All good. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the  I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow. We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. I was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport. | BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer. You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. | I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. The flight from London to Toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to Halifax. We were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful. Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. e have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. We missed one day work and BA didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful. What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. of the flight. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. |  I enjoyed my flight. I made a claim with British Airways to reimburse me but because I didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage, they would only cover 50% of my new luggage. Advice, have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like I did. After booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: ‘sorry, the flight is full.’ The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no apology. The flight left on time (just about), the cabin was clean and the staff friendly. Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water. When walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat. Horrible flight with disappointing staff. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. Next time they change CEO, can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate, budget Irish airline. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. Cabin crew were very good. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too bu sy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. Not Verified |  BA changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to I paid over £300 for the ticket. I had to then rebook it in March and pay another £100. I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. nally, our luggage arrived in Puerto Rico with a 3-day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip ... Nun sitzen wir wieder in Miami am Flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive Verspätung sodass wir unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werden. Zuletzt ist auch unser Gepäck mit 3 Tagen Verspätung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine Info über unser Gepäck erhalten, zum Glück haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… Beim letzten verpspäteten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch sie ihre Anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben Flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen. On the shorter flights the seats couldn't even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information. On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. But on arrival at Heathrow, the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available. Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Now BA is changing planes, they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas (my wife & I) when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional $$ to be re-seated next to each other. They moved our seats away from each other and we shouldn't have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together! I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in Milan. The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. |  At 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4. ternoon flight, understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however it lost us one day's experience in Cairo. The meal was ok but not great, aside the Champagne no European wines on this flight. | Boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to London Heathrow that is very ok, the A320 with rather narrow seats. In business light meal a Caesars salad, a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks - nothing wrong for such a short flight. British Airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline. They announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow. Boarding was ok, flight totally full. Flight itself was ok, landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crew. The only reason we flew BA was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! My return journey was a direct BA flight, 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights. Crew on this flight were really nice too. In flight services were excellent, the crews were friendly with excellent service! British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. The crew are a credit to BA. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. ervice that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Seat was comfortable with good leg room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine. | Excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge, the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket. Flight was slightly delayed out of Heathrow but arrived on schedule in Johannesburg. Arrival lounge was good but showers cold. Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago). Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product. |  Being a silver flyer and booking a flight through BA to Dublin you would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA used Air Lingus for the flight. Come on BA I booked the flight through you, and you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Toilet seats old, stained. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. Staff were ok. Meals were basic. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say \"call after 72 hours\". Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to \"upload my COVID documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. | I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. Not Verified |  When will BA update their Business class cabin - 8 across on a 777. It is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were, but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares! The cabin staff were fine, food acceptable, check-in OK and Business lounge (breakfast) acceptable. Seat was nice enough. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. |  BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from \"upcoming flights\" on the day of departure). Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. ach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. Excellent wine and champag Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner. Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! | Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. afe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. |  Stupidly tried BA again after a five year gap and paid over £7000 for my wife and I to go to Barbados because I thought the new Business Class layout might rival Virgin Atlantic on the route. My wife and I now accept that a BA flight will be late and delayed. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Nothing further was offered. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. |  British Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting ba Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. |  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Extra wait in Milan then. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. | On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. |  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats. ry tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days) |  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future. Flight on A380 left on time. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. He used his phone to place the order. In economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. Thank you for all you do ! Not Verified |  Good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39J and lack of good leg room. British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. No curtesy for business Class check-in while waiting for flights. British Airways is probably the worst air company I have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour. Booked onto a flight the next day. Not Verified |  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t w They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. Drink with meal. Booked my trip via BA.com, with a transfer in Singapore. Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled. |  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA. We had a terrific flight over. Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. |  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase  | Despite BA's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website I have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the Chief Executive) have remained unanswered. I have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to refunds.s[email protected] several times and all they tell me is it’s been processed. |  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. Dedicated BA lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. A good flight overall. |  For this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a bag of potato chips, and a bottle of water. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. Usual clean cut BA product that when it works well is fine. |  Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day before. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare. Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., \"Your bag was loaded onto the plane\"; \"Your bag is on its way to baggage claim\"). In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday. Not Verified |  Booked a flight from London to Paris 2020. We asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchers. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped. I will never again travel with British Airways. |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given  A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. I don't know what \"non payable commercial reason\" is. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. Note: Respect to their cabin crew | BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia. |  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Not Verified |  I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone). Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayed. Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are \"very busy right now\" and our baggage will arrive \"soon.\" Onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. Arrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge. 1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when I entered the plane. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match oth Despite a 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn't make it onto the connecting flight. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. Our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. |  The crew BA656 on 6 June absolutely made this flight. |  Outstanding inflight service from the crew. The crew made the flight outstanding. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that y Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. |  Flight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyond. Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. |  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Not Verified |  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. My suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week. I go to request a voucher again. The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. |  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Not Verified |  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the  As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. |  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the \"leftovers\", my entertainment system was also not working. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag  We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? sh Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit. We will be flying again with British Airways |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this servic Not Verified |  Our Good Friday flight was delayed by 5hours, STD 12.50 ATD 18.00 TO Durban, South Africa from Johannesburg. Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. Not Verified |  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the \"Points game\" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. |  A very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. Crew was wonderful New seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a I have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers. Not Verified |  BA is getting a real bashing on this forum and I thought I'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from EDI to LCY on BA8703 this Monday. Well done BA. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. Sort it out BA. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. | First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. Not Verified |  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. Not Verified |  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. |  Our flight back to Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. |  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace. I spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. Not Verified | Having just booked BA for a return flight - being one hour each way in Club Class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. Not Verified | BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. s done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. Overall, a good flight. |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. ne told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with \"That's the final amount.\" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. |  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. |  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permi Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day. | British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all. flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). ooked with Delta. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. | Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. So BA skimping on lounge, plane condition and gate. Crew good, seats very uncomfortable. |  After 1h queuing at the check-in desk, I am told that my booked seat is not available. Verified |  Outbound, seated in row 10, I was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined). Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. | I have been trying to get a hold of BA to change my return flight for the past week now. I cant change online because I'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online. I have tried calling and the line always drops from their end. It's been easier to change my flights with domestic Latin American Airlines and I don't even speak Spanish. |  This whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. On boarding the next flight, no space to keep the luggage. Not Verified |  Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “Live Chat”. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. We just wanted to be able to make a name change. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. | Another BA shuttle flight and a good one. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. |  Upon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger Locator Forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our Day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distress. Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in. Flight attendants helpful, friendly and professional. Not Verified |  Good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with the beautiful A10 gate at LHR T5(, so we were bussed to I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me. Flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps I agree. The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. When I requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started, I was told that tea would be served after dinner. At dinner, there was no tea service. Not Verified |  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. Booked my flight before Covid. Now I have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although I booked for a flight for Cayman and I still haven’t been able to go. The voucher is valid for another two years, I wonder how many flights will go up by then. nch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight. On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. Complained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual \"we fell short of our standards\" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios to compensate for the lack of service. Usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a UK passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. |  The service is got super inconsistent on BA and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy. The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said I can’t give you the bottle only a glass. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. | Such terrible service in Club World. Asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..'whaa' and then when I said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. Good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch. Wi-Fi access wasn't free for business class passengers: £4.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive. It was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. However, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big Club class cabin. |  No refund for flights cancelled 14 months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until 30 April 2022. |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 \"travel flexibility\" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at le I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. |  The entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time I wanted to open flight map. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands. |  Me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from Moscow Domodedovo to London Heathrow on 11 august. When we landed at Heathrow, my baby was sleeping. I asked stewards for my stroller, and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building. I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. First British airways representative I met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that I have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases. For the flight out from Munich BA had not (re) signed up to the now open lounge in Munich. On board food was very good for a short haul flight. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? Bag from fine, lounge basic, on time departure. Flight generally good. Not Verified |  Booked flight six months before travel, then month before the flight BA cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day - bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasn't ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks. We rebooked the flight- as suggested by them and a week later BA cancelled the rebooked flight. Not Verified |  The airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in London, and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover. That's before I board the flight to Toronto. Called several times but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available. When we boarded, the whole plane was empty and still they didn't allow us to seat together. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Refund was promised in voucher form by call center. |  Boarding and disembarking were greatly organised: passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows, from the backside to the front (business), minimizing the possiblity for jamming. Same at disembarking: passengers were asked to remain seated, then row per row was called. When snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it, This was my first flight since one year, and I appreciated the COVID measures taken by BA - still it left some strange experience. |  Ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight. So not only was my flight cancelled 3 times I wasn’t offered an option to rebook a new flight online I was inconvenienced every step of the way. I recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren't interested in helping me return home. When I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly? On my return journey, the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to take me. When I call to BA several times their computer system didn’t work and they couldn’t issue new ticket, as the result I had to pay airport price for baggage, as I couldn’t pay online without ticket. She also made sure I had eaten my food and stood by next to me as I was feeling awful because I was in lot of pain Not Verified |  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. | This is my first flight since January. Flight on time and well presented A321. Not Verified |  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received. h British Airways as they refunded my tickets Munich-London City-Munich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between British Airways and Lufthansa is night and day. |  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. It took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk, and when we arrived we were told that the check-in had closed (at 7:25am) and that we had missed the flight. I applied for compensation lawfully due me through EC261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in London under the 3-hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly Paris and their CR agent acknowledged this. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there. |  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water). I was due to fly back to London on 25th August 2020 and my flight got cancelled. I made the mistake of exchanging my April flights with BA for a voucher, because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic. I tried to book an August flight using the voucher, but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher. Email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date - service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund. A few days later I started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date (still not the one I wanted, but better) - And 3 weeks later, BA cancelled the return flight! I could not obtain a refund, as the BA website and telephone service made this impossible, it just sent me round in circles. to use the voucher for a flight to Munich, and was informed by the website that I have to call BA for this. British Airways cancels flights due to Pandemic Covid 19. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them. Not Verified |  I booked my honeymoon flight from San Diego to Barcelona in September 2020. I have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel, especially to other countries. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. |  Flight BA 282 on 11 February was delayed 173 mins due to mechanical in London and so I misconnected at London Heathrow and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins late. I requested compensation and was refused - for three e-mails they told me my flight to London was delayed 173 mins (under the 180 mins floor) and I continued to reply that I did not fly to London but to Paris and arrived 205 mins late. My wife and I used Avios and the BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday. The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees. |  My wife and I used Avios and my BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They have no flexibility and despite the fact that BA has money and air miles belonging to me, I cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight, only an air miles flight that they don't have available at the time and route I want. BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, onl What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. | Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. |  At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy. Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA website. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. But two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn’t do this because I had bought a package and that this could only be done by BA. Not Verified |  Very disappointed that BA are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid-19, effectively holding onto my money illegally. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The BA website was updated on 17 March to state \"We’re working closely with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) to continue flying, where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so.\" I then checked the FCO website that was also updated on 17 March and it states: \"The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to Spain.\" So it is clear that BA deem it \"safe\" to fly to Spain despite the FCO statement. British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madeira when the Foreign Office has advised against anything other than essential travel. My wife and her friend were due to fly to Madeira on 17 March for a week's holiday when we found out that the FO had advised against travelling there. |  Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful, narrow business class facing seats. British Airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best, and Club Class is simply terrible. Another grim flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400. Not Verified |  Diabolical that British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the Foreign Office have advised against anything other than essential travel. If that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble. Cancelled my booking for flight refund online, but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards. Flight got canceled. A few years back I took BA, the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since However, my recent flight is good. This could be improved but I appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not BA's partner Overall, BA has really improved the game, and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world |  Hong Kong to London. Unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure, but BA kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court. Good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though. Fortunately, the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight, with great service and positive, friendly attitude. Arrived in London 6 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason. My return flight from London to Sydney was with British Airways, leaving 23 February. I contacted BA, who said I should be able to change my return date, and asked me to send medical documentation, which I did, with an explanatory email. I phoned them, they said they would contact BA. When I phoned Webjet again, they said still no word from BA. When I phoned BA again, they said they couldn't help. A flight attendant provided some medication, came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when I deplaned. |  I am flying London to Seattle in Business Class in May 2020, and British Airways wants around £100 each way for me to choose seats. All other airlines I have encountered allow Business Class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. So, BA takes £100 off me for me so that I can choose my seat and then changes my seat - without asking me. I only flew First because BA's business class is so poor. I was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that, There is a lady in business class is missing a pillow, did I take the pillow. I located my husband in the business class, apparently, his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one. Weird seat configuration, service that needs training, horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by BA. Economy - packed out seating, awful food, very narrow seats, uncomfortable, expensive add ons (seat choice, luggage), try to match Norwegian pricing on the Rio route, IFE was iffy. The staff were great, but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class I’ve experienced. The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle, a business class configuration of 2-4-2. | London Heathrow to Sofia. However the flight overall was very good. As usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at Heathrow's excellent T5. Arriving late to board my Heathrow flight, the Check-In-Staff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor. I was told that because Manchester to Heathrow flight was missed, my Heathrow to S I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. |  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. BA had not paid for the flight! BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. Departed PHX early and arrived into LHR early where immigration and baggage took minutes. Done this route a few times with British Airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment system. I know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. British Airways needs to improve their ground experience. Unfortunately, British Airways only gave me the seats I paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip. I have been fighting with British Airways to get my refund for these seat assignments. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. I would not hesitate flying First class with BA on my next flight. Layout of Boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins (row 42-44 D, E, and F,). However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage. I would recommend BA to others since they are a very good airline. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, I.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full Overall, a good flight. The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. Flight was late. Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. All in all great service, Good flight and felt fully relaxed. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. Cabin crew provided excellent service. The flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water. The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. At the entrance to the BA business lounge there was a sign saying Silver and Gold members only. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly. They gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. We had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in. We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up. On my flight the hot food finished half way through - I was seated on row 22 and by the time the food cart reached my row, there were no sandwiches left to purchase. |  London Heathrow to Rio De Janeiro. Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. All in all another very good flight. The aircraft and the flight quality were good, but they don't provide free food and drink. There is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar Airways. In London granted access to any Oneworld lounge. Onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. Granted lounge access in Billund in the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Which I might add I seldom enjoy food served on flights. I booked a return ticket for my sister though BA, provided travel document details they required. However when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didn't match her passport name. BA are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket. They have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand. I sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didn't owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point. Along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter, BA charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together. away and family had to sit in different seats. Back home, I applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid for them. Awful airline. Gave me middle seat even though many others were free. Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases. I'm a able bodied, fit BA customer and Silver member and was seated at an Emergency Exit seat. A cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. But you get served drinks and food. Proper gin for the G&T and good food. At checked in we asked and were told we had good seats. Never flying BA again. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. As always BA works excellent with service. ood gin aboard for a decent G&T and even if the meals in Business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great. Not Verified | London to Sydney via Singapore. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. How does BA have the gall to call its service \"business class\"? There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats  The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. I had a real good night of sleep though. The breakfast is good. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience. The flight from San Francisco was delayed, so I missed my connecting flight in London to Oslo. If the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage. The flight from Bangalore to London on 10 November 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight. We were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance. I would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight BA0015-Singapore to Sydney -22 Novemb Not Verified |  BA operate daily shuttles from London to Glasgow, its a busy route and I'm sure make money plus there is no competition. However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location. |  Doha to London. Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. They pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline. Thanks to the excellent premium host service, Julie and her colleague, I managed to be on time! BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. | The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a \"mix up\" with paperwork. We missed our connecting flight. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. | Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. Great service on this flight. They were friendly, welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight. |  London to San Francisco return in Economy. The seats are small. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. The cabin staff were pleasant, the food was good. In flight information from the flight deck was good. The return journey was similarly good. I lodged another complaint on 25th October, and still no action. Day time flight back to London. On-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. Easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, I have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again. Flight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in. Food was fine and service friendly. |  We were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our Icelandair flight and rebooked onto BA direct from Toronto to London Heathrow. The flight was quite good. I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. In London I made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait Not Verified |  Zurich to London return. Flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. Business Class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints. Overall very happy with this short flight with BA. Return flight was canceled at London City Airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking, hotel voucher and transportation arranged. Very poor experience my flight with BA. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. We were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation. The seat was uncomfortable, the flight tracker failed after two hours, the breakfast prio I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager. The female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that. All in all, a good flight after 7 hours of sleep |  Edinburgh to London Heathrow. After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019. Yet they charged full-service airline prices. The little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. On the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Having flown Norwegian on their B787 in their premium cabin on the same route, BA is a waste of my money. The food is average, the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes, salad and wine. The cabin crew w We arrived on time and was a great flight. On the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice. Good price, easy boarding, lovely cabin crew, great iced coffee on sale. Comfortable, on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing. Honestly, they were really good, legroom great, crew excellent - looked after us superbly, food and drinks were bang on, did Vegas in April too, nowt wrong with this airline. The new \"business suite\" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. | Flight from London to Athens with British Airways, was one of the worst experiences. Not Verified |  Short 45 minute flight north and south with British Airways. Yesterday I traveled on BA 34 from Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow, I boarded the flight with an open mind, over 12 hours later I disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it’s customers. A praise is due and I want to congratulate BA for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that mad A good flight, on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect. I was booked on a flight from Newark to Madrid via London. I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. I will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as well. Not Verified |  One of the reasons we traveled club class was because BA have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children. On my outbound flight (23 Sept) I gave BA almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete. From entering Alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the VIP lounge which was good). Outstanding in flight service from the crew. I have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months - Vueling Airlines has best seats! So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. Get yourselves down to good ole Austin now that BA fly there direct. It was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. Smooth flight, departure/arrival on time. | Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. I will never fly BA again. | Flying London City to Geneva. Other than that BA now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline. Flight between London and Istanbul is like coach, no TV and small leg room. |  London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. An email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. Certainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home. Staff said that if he did not pay, he would lose the flight. | London to Abuja-flight full, aircraft an older version of 777-200. Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos - and had to be flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour delay. Flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight. The crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane - they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat. Boarding was direct from the Business Lounge and on time as was departure. Boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift. No complaints at all about the flight and would recommend British Airways. Two recent flights on BA, and very happy with them. Terrible flight experience, bed bugs in old Club world seats, missed meals, poor service. Early morning flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug did not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy, smooth flight down. Gatwick to Tampa, according to manage my booking, aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure. This is the daytime flight from London. A very good flight. s changes in food service). I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. #happyautism# Thank you |  Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via London. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okay. Not Verified |  I have often flown British Airways and have considered them a good airline. If you have no problems this is a good airline. Do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. | My flight was cancelled 3 days in a row. Was flying out on Thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with BA, I got a flight out Saturday night with Swiss Air. They on the other hand actually fly and on time. My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Flight to Pisa on time, good crew, good on board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time. | A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. An overall very good experience on board this flight. On the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock. |  London to Larnaca. The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. To book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight. After all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways. Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor. Arrived Heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up. Many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected  Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. How does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management? British Airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by Easyjet Not Verified |  London to Faro. Inbound flight seats has been booked and paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for the row 2 and 3. Outbound flight row 6 and 7. Two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to \"unlucky\" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. I am extremely upset (that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason), disappointed and you can no longer rely on British Airways. In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. |  Nice to Kuwait via London. My flight from Nice was delayed in the plane for 2 hours and in delayed in Heathrow for 5 hours. |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by Boeing 777-300ER. The seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. The films provided are not that many but I can see the flight path through the personal television. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. The 777 aircraft is looking old, the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped, the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens (films are OK, the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OK. The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. The worst business class experience I have had. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleled. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old BA Premium Economy seats), then it would be perfect. The food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. |  The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in London the problems started. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Worst business class flight I have flown. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. | Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! What is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered TSA line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it. Business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat. Within a few days of booking a flight for December, BA advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival. | Madrid to London with British Airways. There is nothing left of business class on these flights. (See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. Our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 8.50pm, so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car. The plane was delayed getting to Sardinia, and so we waited: but following check-in at Sardinia we were penned into long lines, no seats, extreme heat and no water in the queues. After waiting for 6 hours at Rotterdam airport (delays) I was told they re-routed my flight to Amsterdam and that I needed to quickly catch a taxi (that I have to pay for) from Rotterdam to Amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there. Had I known we’d be re-routed to Amsterdam I would’ve left Rotterdam earlier, rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end. |  Return flight to Dublin. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed. We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. t BA0011 from London Heathrow to Singapore on 25 June. | Madrid to London Heathrow. | BA762 Heathrow to Oslo I have flown with BA a few times in the last few months, I have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes, I had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me. | Hamburg to Abu Dhabi via London Heathrow. I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. ive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. | London Heathrow to New York. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. Service very good, food was the best I have had from BA, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdue. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British Airways. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return b Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. |  Amsterdam to London on 15th April. Not having the ability to ring abroad I asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no Qantas office in Amsterdam and they cannot help me. The seat does not recline, is very thin and OK for an hour flight. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. Our return flight from KL to London was very cold, the Boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat. No free drinks or food, which is pretty normal for short haul flights. Crew was pretty average Seat was average. My Business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long-hauls flight! ❎ Not Verified | Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. |  Miami to Delhi via London. Checked in with a bag which was 23.4kg. I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. annesburg to London. I booked a seat without luggage. Firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. When the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. |  London to Milan. ivacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). | CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience. There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight. The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. A 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. |  The cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients. Keep up the good service and, thanks! The food and drink offering was very good. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched. Before boarding the flight I was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and I was boarding in Group 5. |  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. Same happened on flight out too. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition. Seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training. A BA Cityflyer service. Cabin service was pleasant and professional. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. |  London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways. I missed out on the airline meal and when I realised I buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problem. Later when the liquid refreshment cane round, both my neighbour and I requested water and I had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum. No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine. Skilled landing in Gibraltar- a good flight |  London to Boston. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. tting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. |  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. On both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. st flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. The 1.5h flight from Hamburg to Heathrow was like flying a budget carrier. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. |  Madrid to London BA0457 on the 18/03. Stephen, one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience I have had in a long time. Check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options. The crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentive. | The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are very good. Three times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive. |  Dallas to London Heathrow in First Class. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, \"we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us\". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. BA website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport check-in (the only available option) starts 2 hours before departure. No lounge available (there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers, except BA). I paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when I got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and I can't get on the plane. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for. |  Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. Last long haul BA flight for me. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. , mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. Cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley. Since the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flight. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. All in all the service was good and worth the price. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. I thought this was a good flight. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which  they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. You will get an email a month later saying \"I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund\". flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. The nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. |  I was flying London to Billund today via British Airways and I was a bit hesitant as I’ve never flown with this airline, due to early morning traffic I was running a little behind schedule and I had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs. It all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from San Diego to Heathrow. On long flights like this I always reserve an aisle seat. B On my flight to San Diego 5 days ago, my TV screen was gone and there was no way to change seats. | Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issues. When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. |  London Heathrow to Paris CDG. At Johannesburg used BA galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy. Plane boarded on time, very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit, given aircraft at JNB all day, perhaps this could have been addressed. After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. | New York JFK to London Heathrow with British Airways. Not Verified |  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. | New York to London via Geneva with British Airways. Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. My first experience of the new Club World catering which seemed to go well Slept for 5 hours, lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777’s which (as my son says) have a gap between stool and seat sometimes. A good flight |  BA836 on 19 Jan. Excellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club Europe. The Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. On arrival in Dublin the ground service from Swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal. My frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too. The business class seats were small for business class and pretty old. Food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class. Overall BA have to do better to be on top of their game. The last flight I took BA to use my Avios points and I literally flew f |  Miami to London. The breakfast served just before landing was terrible. A terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit bar. | Copenhagen to Amsterdam via London Heathrow with British Airways. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? If you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member, they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. They’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap. . Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. I was in Barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check. Eight days later, they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery. So if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges? |  We recently flew from London to Bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. Lovely staff and great service. A dirty plane, fantastic front line staff I would never fly BA again. At the airport I was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost. the passenger in front reclines his/her seat, it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one's seat. As the arm rests do not go all the way up, the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over. Legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat. The seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read British Airways' magazine or even use my iPad. We ordered special meals (Halal and low sodium). I have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags. |  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. rived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. Eurostar). The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation). When arrive at London I realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. After booking the flight and trying to upgrade, was notified that I could not upgrade the flight due to how I purchased the ticket, paid about $250 for early seat selection on both flights, after buy up to the front of the plane, was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation, - but found out they gave the seats, that I paid extra for, to another party. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. This is my first time flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. I checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can I have aisle seat and she just said no. They served dinner and said we don’t have any more chicken so you can have pasta. I told him I don’t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food. |  Our flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problems. They offered us a flight that would arrive in London late November 8th. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the \"new\" 1st Class is holding up. Much has been said about the seat being \"an up market business class\" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. The food is also business class quality. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the \"cheap\" look of their premium product. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. Fantastic first class service. For supper I asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as I don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons. I explained I don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water.\" We don't keep hot water, I can get it once we have finished serving all other customers\". I kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining I have been waiting. Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at £1,000+  Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told \"We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that\". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. If you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. One of the worst business class experience. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and fin They are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. | Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City via London. However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on food. So, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them again. | Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. My entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as well. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy. On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge. I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly |  Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. I rejected BA's offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. At the booking in I was told that they could not find \"proof\" that I had paid for selected seats. On return, BA customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movie. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay l The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. I was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat. Business class still 3 seats each side of the isle. I fly KLM 90% of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely. I’m sure it’s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day. You are not allowed laptops on the flight from Riyadh, so you cannot work if you want to. During check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. |  New York to Budapest via London. Although a BA flight, this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience. Both my flights were great, on time and the food was good on the flight to London, and a nice bottle of champagne as well. My long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended. |  While it is still fresh in my mind, I’d like to commend the hard working crew of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd October 2018. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. ptions were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. Once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by 40 minutes. Other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required. Waiting at gate, the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high. MAN-LHR I am not tall so the Club Europe seating is fine for me on a short flight. LHR-PHL on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape though. Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional. Upon arrival in LHR others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me. Dealing with BA lost luggage/customer service was brutal, they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it woul Flight home from LHR-YYZ was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn't stay upright. I was shocked that BA provides buy onboard short haul flights - no free water, coffee or tea. The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly. Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. The seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice. Overall it was one of the best flights I had. When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price. British Airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage. The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. It was a connecting flight, so I should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine clean and? During 7 hours flight staff is always there. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. Food was very tasty and well presented. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. It’s hard to see the point of BA’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate. The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom. Not Verified |  Glasgow to Miami via London. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done BA and looking forward to return journey. |  London Heathrow to Budapest. p of this no one sat next to me, so I had better seat than the people in Euro Club (Business class) since their legroom is the same as on economy class. Business Class seating in 787/9 very conducive for family travelling, allows for interaction. Outstanding crew on BA 603 and BA 99 - on our outgoing flights from Toronto on August 16 similar great service. The food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable - and as for customer service, there is no point in ringing them they are useless, rude, hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever. Singapore to London. They wanted to charge me an extra GBP65 for being over the 23kg limit. |  Washington to Frankfurt via London. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. Seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes. In the last 12 months I have had some of the worst airline food served from BA or Cathay Pacific and this includes my most recent travels with British Airways. Thankfully BA airline staff are always the best. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business  The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. Both my husband and I ordered low sodium meals. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal. After writing to British Airways regarding disappointing flight, BA customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a $63USD voucher toward future BA travel to make up for their shoddy service. |  Zagreb to London and during the check-in (24 hours before, I checked in via app) I was offered no choice of seating. First flight Milan to San Francisco via London, while returning flight was from Los Angeles to Milan always via London. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. Of course the usual BA Club Class \"scramble over the legs\" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge char ge to pre-reserve seat. If Virgin Atlantic fly the same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat. |  London to Paris. Especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects. We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said \"oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk\". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. BA charges to select Business Class seats. The plane itself was old, I found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be checked in for security purposes. BA refused to rebook us at the airport, instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to Milan via Madrid a day later. I was flying premium economy with BA and surprised that I got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average). But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!). So, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. A few problems at Heathrow with the wrong gate being shown (BA ground staff didn't seem to care this was an issue) but the flights were excellent, comfortable and on time. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. Further, the promised \"rebooking\" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. 3hr delay on return flights. Flight to Heathrow was average, what you expect from a 2 hour flight. When I boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room, it was less than the flight before. the food was delicious, had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks, the flight staff was kind and helpful. Staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight. However, the in flight product has deteriorated - salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers - had to have sandwich. No priority boarding for business passengers. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. I won't fly with BA again until they change their baggage restrictions for the Saudi flights. When booking the tickets, I realised that by choosing certain flights in Club the fare was cheaper than economy once I had added suitcases and pay for food onboard, I hadn´t flown BA Club in Europe for a while and was looking forward to it. Seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for BA to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger's legs to get out from the window seat in the night. I found the seats weren't wide enough and leg room was restricted. On the way back to London the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room I had to move. | Flew London Heathrow to Hong Kong with British Airways. At the passport/visa check desk, presented printed boarding pass to the BA lady - my wife was holding the passports. The lady looked at the boarding passes and barked 'Passports' as if she did not see my wife holding them. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. |  Munich to London Heathrow with British Airways. I arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a Salzburg coffee shop. It was outrageous of British Airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when I checked in at LHR on the 05/07. British Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, li I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don’t want any particular seat. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit. BA bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don’t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this. Cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on BA169 London to Shanghai on 22 June. Upon arrival in Shanghai I was not the only one from BA169 reporting missing luggage. Having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the BA website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft. Our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an A321 aircraft is standard seat pitch. |  I recently took a first class flight from London Heathrow to Las Vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline. British Airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty - it’s about time they  had a deep clean and re-model the first class it’s getting so old, it’s like club class with a few tweaks. This delay would have meant we missed our connection in Heathrow to Miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies). Their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but I was charged £65 to bring my bike back. Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with. Group boarding was super slow. The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. Given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok. Small things like the menu presentation, boarding sufficient food (there are a lot of seats in F), seat comfort (OK, but nothing special) and the toilets (small and curiously offering single-ply paper). Disappointed of the disservice I called the customer service in England (and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator) and I was offered a flight in the evening at 1900, which did not help me to arrive in ti British Airways did not take responsibility, I was not reimbursed the new flight I had to book last minute nor the taxi difference. Then we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at 4.30 pm yesterday. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apolog | We can not fault the new 'Club World' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. We do mainly Club Europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new Club World will be a great success. Return flight on A380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flight. Evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. Customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing I received the following response, \"Thanks for coming back to us. I completely understand why you’re disappointed we couldn’t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flight. This meant they couldn’t provide a full meal service and I absolutely agree this isn’t what you would expect when you travel with us. The service isn’t good either, you don’t even get a cup of water. It’s great to hop to London, but don’t expect any kind of special treatment or service. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. Return flight from Vegas was on a old 747. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747. BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation. No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. This was our first business class experience with BA. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. Seats and everything was comfy enough, although my girlfriends television didn't work for either the outbound or inbound flight, and little effort was made for a resolution. On the flight from Gatwick to Tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30-40 minutes as the bridge 'wasn't where it should be' which once again wasn't the worst problem In the world but after a long flight isn't particularly what you wanted! There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. I’ve just stepped onto a BA flight from Gatwick to Costa Rica, an 11.5 hr flight, and can honestly I haven’t seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s. I  fly other long haul flights and none of BA’s competitors are providing such low quality entertainment. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!! They walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. I would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to Europe. On a positive point the Geneva to London flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to Vancouver were abysmal. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. re then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. |  Washington to Bucharest return via London. I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. But a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you're the best. The seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2-hour flight. Once on board, the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour. The flight arrived in Istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury, the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Overall, a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. I show the staff my mobile boarding pass, checked website that I have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance. One bag was over 23 kg (27/28), they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me I will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in. Flight was delayed without the checked-in agent saying anything, after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather. |  When I checked in the evening before for the 7am flight, it looked like only 40% of seats were occupied. Desperately poor service from British Airways in Club Class. Business Class is utterly outdated, with the weird \"facing each-other configuration\", and narrow / uncomfortable seats. The problem with British Airways now in First and Business Class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoever. Poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, No WIFI and an overall budget airline experience. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Lovely flight and a great BA Worldwide Crew, which are the best in the BA fleet. Overall, a lovely flight, with a great airline, that has a great crew |  London Heathrow to Singapore on 28 May 2018. World Traveller passengers have the option to pre-order from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of LHR with prices ranging from £15 to £18. If you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul BA flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route, I highly recommend you to go for it. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. The years have not been kind to BA. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. lack of polish with the soft product. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago. check in rather than actual flight. There were 4 desks 2 for priority, 2 for general check in for all flights. Only 1 desk served, once they were about to close check in |  Munich to London-Heathrow with British Airways. The flight was not very full. This was a typical intra-European flight on British Airways where food and drinks are for sale. You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new \"slimline\" seats, I'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. |  I had called the British Airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at London Heathrow from Washington Dulles to Glasgow. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn't working, so I proceeded to the BA counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed. On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR. Luckily I've made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. Unfortunately BA decided to cut the the service on European flights in the race to the bottom. One passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep – another example of BA’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna – quite as to how, is beyond me. Their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my BA exec club membership so I'd had to book it as two flights. I lost my jacket on the Shanghai to London flight and ground staff at Heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow on B777 in Club World. The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. Understand BA plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. Return flight was similar, but Heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time. My last flight on BA was over 30 years ago, it was a real premium carrier then. |  Overnight club world flight from Rio to London. Flight landed on time, priority bags worked and were off quickly. However, BA were not the lowest cost option on this route (at the time of booking that was Air France- a carrier I rate highly), but they were a direct flight. The 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft, even though I paid for premium economy the seat was hard, small and uncomfortable, it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back, the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off. The washroom had a leak and when I used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks, the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said I shouldn’t have worn socks. The food was a good standard. I have had several replies in that time but on each occasion, the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in Venice. British Airways re-booked me on the next flight, but downgraded me from Business to Economy and into a centre seat. It was all handled very poorly, late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via Air France or one of the middle east carriers who value my business. A bit more legroom but that won’t justify the £200 price difference on a 2hr flight. |  Paid for a Vueling Airlines flight from Florence to Gatwick and bumped off flight. Good WiFi. Aircraft was a 777-300 so in flight entertainment was good. | Worst BA flight ever! No greeting by the door, shown to economy despite business seat. | Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Dusseldorf. The main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly, and hard working. BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. In Summary it is unacceptable that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change. I recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendline Seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. | BA used to be a byword for quality and service. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but at far lower prices. BA used to be a first choice but at this price, for this service, it’s become a last resort. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Stressful day started with a 2.5 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am. I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight whe BA has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again in a hurry. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. I had an extra bag that I paid $200 for in Dallas, our flight got delayed in Dallas, therefore we missed our flight to Lagos. When we got to London, we went to the BA counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a Virgin Atlantic flight to Lagos. On getting to Virgin Atlantic counter, we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from BA, we decided to do that. Overall the airplane was old with little space to seat. The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on. |  My bag was damaged on a BA flight in December 2017. All looked good when I got to the airport customer services counter - was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call. I got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later I decide that something is better than nothing and call K2, to get the bag they offered me, only to find that BA have closed my case and they won't send one. Finally get through to BA and they finally agree to put me back to K2 to get the bag offered. Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier. Drinks and food service served efficiently. It's bad that BA requests additional payment to select seats before the check-in. This also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. Aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space. To ensure that I sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor. I was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door. The return flight was on time, the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. flight leaving Berlin to London was delayed, in which I was worried about missing my connecting flight from London to Hong Kong. | London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. But there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4. |  London to Cabin staff made me feel like I was the only person they were serving. I was very sick/nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off British Airways literally nursed me back to health. | It was a 13 hours flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur with British Airways, and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served. For the breakfast, the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals (up until 40 minutes before landing, they were still serving), I waited for my turn but no food came so I asked. Also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me, i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face. The bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food. Service at the British Airways business class counter at Beijing airport was pleasant. The business lounge was quiet when we were there, however, food options were very limited, we were there in the morning, the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options. The flights served the worst food. The other London-Moscow flights provide a full meal. When the flight touched down, it was 75 minutes before we disembarked, 6 British Airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whils When it comes to meal choice, the main course I had selected (non veg Indian dish) was not available. It is shame that BA is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengers. The crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite, but I just cannot take it that British Airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers, where everything is charged for, apart from luggage. Another regular flight by British Airways, which has turned into a low cost airline, given the total no frills service they provide. The staff are extremely nice and polite, but in the short haul flights you only get luggage. As the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. |  I booked my flight with Cathay Pacific,  the route between Stockholm and London was operated by British Airways. For a 2.5 hour flight, they do not offer anything free on board, there was no individual screen or USB charge at the seat for this short European flight. | Flew British Airways from Lisbon to London Heathrow. The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they  I skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal. When I asked another air steward for a bottle of water, he told me they don't have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal. Was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight? My co passenger asked for a menu - answer - you are booked for veg meal - so that will be served. | I flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hong Kong in Club World on a A380. The cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight). On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. Flying in BA's Club Europe is a miserable experience, and I think they have the lowest standard of all European airlines. Service and food are mediocre. This time I had to fly from Edinburgh to London Gatwick and I end up with mix feelings. Due to the space between seats I would avoid flying with BA in short haul flights. Flew Chicago - London Heathrow in Upper Deck / Club World, of ancient B747-400, British Airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry. At the age of 20 years, the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating. However having got up at 5am for the flight time at 10.45, if we hadn’t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service, which was served what seemed like a long time after take off. We have flown similar routes on Thomas Cook and TUI planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this BA flight, which I think is shameful for the national carrier. For most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time. I was told that several Executive Club members and Avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that BA might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with Avios points. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. I gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any options. After couple of hours over the call, I am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from MSY to DFW and London and Hyd and the layover is very short and I am very tense as I don't have any options to choose. This whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really bad. No tea or coffee offered while on business on that flight. Cancelled inbound flight to London due to technical issues of aircraft. | A fairly average flight to Cape Town and return. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. However I would probably still choose BA to Cape Town in order to fly direct. We arrived in London Heathrow Terminal 5 approx. The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? | I really enjoyed my flight from London to Johannesburg. All flights left on time but the HYD-LHR one arrived an hour late. As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite  Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones. The flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. This was the last of those flights. The flight I was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Our investment in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.” The experience with BA has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday! The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. od and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. Served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery. Plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly. Bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight. She informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. Overall good flight and service. But they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to London - the New York to London flight got 3 hours delay, therefore we missed our connection in London. We waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight from London to Paris, this flight got also cancelled, we rebooked a flight and waited another 2 hours. This flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time. After 30 hours we got home and complained to British Airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight, Eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but they never answered. Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn't turned up. When asked for meal choice, options didn't correspond with what was on menu. Asked FA if I had wrong menu. Ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat. Flight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. Arrived Tobago 5 hrs late. Not on this flight. I can remember when a flight on BA club class was something to look forward to. Not so any more, based on these 2 flights. | No curtains in business class: once again British Airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they don’t matter. This flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class: passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet. Had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with Iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for Business Class flights BA still wanted £20 per person each way to pre book our seats. When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. I was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabrück but was told I could file online. I tried to call the number I was given but the agents in Madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after I explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage office. I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. When I asked, please may I have some snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. Well done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again. We departed and landed on time (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and I really appreciate this every time.) So, what to say, British Airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best European airlines. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. Overall very pleased with British Airways and the service provided. Will look to fly BA again later this year. Arrived at a bus gate in London. Crew blamed the bus providing company. Boarding was quick and smooth, flight was not too busy. It's an incosistent product, as on the outbound flight there was service, on the inbound flight no service. After talking to one of the agents for hour and a half, I was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from Charlotte instead of New York. The meal I requested was not available on the new flight. While flying back from London to New York on November 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn’t have our requested meal available! On my flight back to New York I requested water to one of the attendants and she didn’t turn back for 9 minutes! A big name like British Airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff. | Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Just too efficient for you I guess. The cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. BA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. The chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. I really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. The driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. BA has been taken over for air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haul only. Outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. | I flew Premium Economy from London to Cape Town on British Airways. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. BA does not have the best first class product, but their staff is the best in Europe. As usual the did the standard in Dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn’t - after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn’t started. Again, as usual, Club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. Aircraft was very dated, IFE poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. IFE was good and the meal wasn’t bad. When I asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there. Called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy. For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. To make it worse, when we landed in London we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because BA didn't have a spare arrivals gate. delays, we had to run like mad people to get from Heathrow to Gatwick in time for our onward flight with BA. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. | I was on a flight from New York JFK - Budapest via London Heathrow on 9th December The flight was delayed 6hrs, when I arrived to London I got information that my flight to Budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow. I was there with a few thousends other passengers from BA, nobody gave us any food, any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase. I won’t be flying with British Airways again. | I was quite disappointed with my experience with British Airways. First of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in LHR. Once on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying Ryanair or British Airways. | Flew British Airways to Pisa due to flight times and BA miles. You had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of BA and they predict other airlines will follow suit. Those who have BA miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. BA is no longer UK's national airline. I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers. | Great flight out from London to Santiago. While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. Hard to complain about a flight which last 35 mins but I was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection. |  London to Seattle, a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about. Efficient and professional service, meal service fine, good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra. |  Seattle to London. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. Noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful. I noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the Concorde lounge per se. \"Just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge.\" This option was rammed. Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. The seat (the new \"First\") - is not wearing well. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. One would think, BA would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food. | Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. My wife was told the beef was now \"unavailable\". My friend had beef and so did I - when challenged on this I was told - only 3 beefs aboard! 3 beefs. Flight was smooth all the way home. Agree with other recent reviews: BA quality is severely lacking compared Then my most recent trip was to Miami which I had an expired ESTA but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a £1000 new flight. | Flew London Heathrow to New York JFK. Have flown this route a number of times with British Airways, but this was my first experience with the new Club World offerings (White Company bedding, improved catering, refurbished 747 club world cabin). Both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous Club World catering offering and the new ‘pick your starter and desert’ options from the display trolley is a real nice touch. The new bedding makes the Club World bed much more comfortable to sleep on. I was told that I will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation. They told me that I will get the refund within 7 days. All I want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund. Just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console, was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like British Airways. We should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to San Francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via Washington! Ironically, the BA personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from Amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was full. On the date of the flight I received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so I could check in my carry on luggage for free, later on another text saying that I will have 46 minute delay. Then a British airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number. The security officer told me that I lost the flight because my flight was at 12:00 and suggested me to go to counter C1. Now at the counter C1 a lady told me that the flight was at 12:00 and I lost it. Unfortunately, the London to Doha was operated by British Airways. The FAs were really dull, nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like FAs from other airlines. BA really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin. The flight out to Sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to maximise their sleep. During the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only? Horrible food, aircraft, LHR and transfer experience. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. I hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (£45) - but I did expect BA to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture. We were being asked to check-in our hand luggage or, in some cases, to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. Fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. Some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. What I didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. They always fall back down and there was never seat liners. Every single seat was occupied. We arrived at Bologna Airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. ❎ Not Verified |  My husband and I booked our honeymoon to Italy through American Airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines, British Airways. (We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. However, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J class. And further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. Even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. It also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated. Until my return flight - entertainment system was not working - ancient plane same miserable food. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates, Etihad which are far more superior. On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. ✅ Verified Review |  I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled. I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterparts. ✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I booked two round trip business class air tickets from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls with British Airways / Comair. It turned out that our business class seats were n It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking. When I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - \"all airlines do it\". rom my destination, in order to avoid the same thing happening, I decided to check in online 24 hours before. However, I was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by. Apparently, the return flight is overbooked again! I had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming back from my destination. The cabin interior was worn and quite grubby, the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class. The meal and presentation is really a joke, and on my previous long haul biz trip I got better food in Lufthansa premium economy. Chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting BA because of the fall in standards - I'm not surprised and I for one would not use them again for long haul. The service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced. ✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Duba BA want to charge me over £500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though I would have given them over 2 months notice. This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another £38 extra. I booked seat 23D but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24E. ✅ Verified Review |  New York to London Heathrow. It is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths, but washroom / shower facilities are downmarket. While I only needed minimal service onboard,  the staff were courteous and efficient,  and they are one of very few good things left after BA after their CEO seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years! Arrival into T5 at Heathrow,  B satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam, and a reason I would choose another airline on this route. ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech, the cabin crew was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds . After 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn’t finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone. After another 10 Minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving. I enjoyed BA's in-flight \"movie snack\" as well. The \"Flight Map / Tracker\" wasn't working on one segment, which was a bit surprising. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as sch Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Madrid. Planes are the worst of the BA fleet, check-in is a nightmare because they operate each other’s flight, but the online check in does not recognize each other’s booking references. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Zurich. ✅ Verified Review |  Bari to Gatwick. Check in excellent, not BA staff and security at Bari a breeze. ✅ Verified Review |  Early morning 0710 flight London Heathrow to Gibraltar. ways have started charging for food and drink on European flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than Ryanair or Easyjet. We were seated at the rear of the cabin, since BA started to charge I have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at the front. Before there would have been 2 with 1 at the front and 1 at the rear, now by the time the cart get to you it is 1.5 hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things. Plane left on time. Return flight started in the shared lounge. Same plane back (recognizable by the flush button in the loo - unless all the BA319s Morale very low thanks to the miserable, mean cost cutting by the BA CEO, Mr Cruz, who has no idea on how to run an airline. The First Class cabin was literally falling apart with loose / yellowed bins, and filthy carpets. The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class, and those passengers kept using the First Class toilets. Would fly with BA again on short sectors, and LCY is an excellent airport to use. ✅ Verified Review |  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably. Cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. If price isn’t everything don’t fly BA. Was looking forward to eventually flying with British Airways after flying reguarly to Bangkok with other airlines - how disappointed I was. ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Bari. ✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. VIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there - cost cutting ?? In board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice man. ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Malaga. flight with BA from new home at South Terminal at London Gatwick. I ended up buying a new single outbound flight as BA app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight. In the UK I received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from BA. Upon arrival at Heathrow I was told BA had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings. We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. We will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating! I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Faro. Staff were all excellent. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Madrid in economy class. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. ✅ Verified Review | I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected. In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights? I am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA! ✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Paris via London, after flying with them I have to admit it's probably the worst airline I have been flying. There were a few noticeable differences on the aircraft there was in-flight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the TV screen. Comparing this flight to my recent flights from London City with BA Cityflyer, there is a vast standard in the cabin service standards. The staff that looked after us flying out to Florida and home were outstanding, on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children, I was really worried about flying home away from my children, I spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. I’m spoilt flying gulf airlines, but this time I tried a rear facing “internal” 4 of 345 configuration. Firstly, staring in the face of my two new best friends (seats facing forward) was at best weird, and at worst like a business class speed dating experience. Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers. BA, you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service. re was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the Marks and Spencer to buy menu were not available at all. ✅ Verified Review |  Athens to London. The company really needs to look after their processes ✅ Verified Review |  A return British Airways flight from London to Sofia was a service of 2 halves. The return flight from Sofia to London was the opposite. With only drinks and crisps available towards the end. flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Avoid if possible ✅ Verified Review | BA used to be a nice airline with great customer service, those days are long gone. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. These old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely A380, and the entire First Class and Club Class product should be reviewed / enhanced. The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I’m not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). The BA offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy. The seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch. Cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods. ✅ Verified Review | I booked British Airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier. Aircraft long haul new and clean, short haul a bit old, but still acceptable. Short hauls don't have any food. The sale of food and drinks went well and didn't appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour. It might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines I have flown with. A single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, I o Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too. But the actual flight experience was lacking and in future I will consider Easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money. e bare minimum in Club Europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the M&S stuff in economy, which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing. I am a one world emerald member on AA so I get certain perks when flying British Airways such as free seat selection, lounge use and priority boarding - that makes this airline bearable - just. Departed on time, paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door, don'0t bother as it has no pocket for documents, glasses etc.. Departing Abuja on return trip I had an aisle seat, again narrow and extremely uncomfortable. Return flight was on time. Meal standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the BA move to being budget standard airline at premium prices. Cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at BA. The Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight. Especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible. Club Europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight, particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service. Overall, a reasonable flight, although Club Europe is poor value by competitors' business class standards. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need to use the restroom? Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. Overall, very poor and disappointing experience. ✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a Tier 2 airline. Terminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and would choose BA for my next holiday. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Not left wanting the whole flight. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and land The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed \"pack them in\" compared to any other business class flight I have taken. Cost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good. Meal served quickly. All through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). nt was good and flight was smooth most of the way. An exceptionally ordinary flight, both for good and for bad. Cabin crew were disinterested -- I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service -- something I'd never felt before. ✅ Verified Review |  I had a return flight to Istanbul in Club Europe. So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. I said, \"I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal.\" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off. Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. Now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to choose again. Ok main meal, I'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red Thai curry so no choice really and I decide to give up and go to a restaurant when I disembark. ✅ Verified Review |  Having flown First Class from London to Cape Town and Club back from Johannesburg I have really noticed a significant downgrade in BA service and standards compared to premium flights I have taken in previous years. On the return Club flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had to ask for a G&T, eventually I only received it by going to the galley. These flights were 'miles burn', I won't be accruing more avios with BA. Having read about BA's cut backs on service, I approached my flight with slight trepidation. r, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bucharest. Also the BA cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently, which slows the process down too. The buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us abo ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Keflavik was a good experience. Despite being an executive member and booking seats 9 months before on most flights, my last 3 flights I have had my seats changed. ✅ Verified Review |  San Jose to London Gatwick return. The outward flight was delayed for an hour at San Jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals. British Airways lost one of my bags on our way to Iceland for a week long vacation. However, when I attempted to contact British Airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room, I was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers. The delayed bag contained our sleeping bags and tent for a one week camping trip. ✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow. I flew JAL on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious. On my return I felt embarrassed that BA is our national airline, mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality. ✅ Verified Review |  Absolutely appalling airline. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). Overall the flight was pretty regular from BA, but the good ground staff, useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew, made it a good service. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew Zurich to London Heathrow. I have flown 14 times with British Airways in the last 5 months. ✅ Verified Review |  New York to Cape Town via London Heathrow. Cabin Crew from JFK was excellent, to Cape Town was passable. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible. BA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airline. [Still not happy that I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to have a great BA lounge. Partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight. It is with regret that I have to admit that I have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another provider. I have Bronze status with BA Executive Club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in Business and in Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that I chose to collect points with this particular airline. I had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other BA flights in May); this (incidentally: ghastly TUI) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight I booked that I lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund wh The airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight, along with EU compensation, after I sent a second email a month after my first claim, as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agent. On the flights I have booked which have actually taken place, I have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in BDX when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. It is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted. Negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in JNB, although hot breakfast was offered which I didn't partake in. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew Oslo to Philadelphia via London. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Warsaw. I had paid more than GBP 260 for a return ticket and had no free food services whatsoever. ✅ Verified Review | Athens to London with British Airways. No contact With British Airways, you paid full price for a low cost service. I am a BA Gold member and reserved three BA business class tickets to Chicago returning from Denver. The lounge attendant, however, curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes. The customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasn’t him who downgraded the ticket! I spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights, but they were all full. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate. I paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to The class I had booked was not available on the alternative Qatar Airways flight, and British Airways refused to upgrade me, so they could only downgrade to Economy. Leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight. Service very indifferent, impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to Britain's flag carrier! Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways is quickly becoming a low quality, low cost services, but premium priced airline. It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices. About 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight. ems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties. ✅ Verified Review | The London Heathrow to Accra flight is regularly late leaving LHR by 1 -2 hours (as a regular on this route for 18 years I have spent many hours delayed at LHR). d to get to the gate as a BA premium passenger. She blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. By the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. Whilst this seems fair enough, the plane was actually 1hr late leaving Gatwick in the first place so had it left on time, it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did. I will not be using BA again. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. I for one will not be flying BA business again. Although we were flying Economy as BA Gold members we had access to the lounge. We left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. ✅ Verified Review |  The flight from Budapest to London was delayed by 22 hours, during which time British Airways offered nothing (no help with hotel reservations, despite limited hotel availability due to the World Swimming Championships, no food, no transport to and from the airport). We were told that a BA representative would meet us at our Heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers, but he / she wisely didn't show up, because I, for one, was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which I won't get back rather than some airport food vouchers. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways cancelled my flight and put me on a EVA Air flight which had a different baggage allowance and I had to pay a £140 excess. After the whole episode, I wrote an e-mail requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced baggage. As for the flight experience, poor. In-flight entertainment was also poor, very limited selection of movies. ✅ Verified Review |  Bergen to London Heathrow. Flight from Newcastle to Heathrow fine, although paying for a cup of tea with Avios was not especially slick. A superb flight from Heathrow to Boston, even though it was the day the latest BA strike started (19th July). All BA crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for BA, I would happily fly with them again soon. The main difference with BA now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff I encountered. As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. But if I paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes I'd be disappointed. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Berlin return. Arriving at Berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile items. Another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no. Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat. Fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Madrid, a weekend flight. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA). Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. Have to say this services is no better than Easyjet & I will think twice about travelling with BA. Food was okay and I was pleasantly surprised. The IFE was old, but worked, it did not last time. Started in an uninspiring visit to the BA lounge, with a poor food choice and poky. Flight was on time and ground service was smooth. Cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats - now BA is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines! Efficient check in, third party lounge at Mauritius airport was a reasonable place to spend time before the flight with usual facilities. After a 12 hours + flight this would have been quite welcome. I wasn’t allowed into the First Class lounge despite being a BA Gold List member. Usual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up (BA train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again) to serve food and drinks. I was glad when the four hour flight ended - nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that. The flight was delayed by an hour and a half. BA policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. However, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or t Another lady had been there since 11 am (her flight earlier that day was delayed) and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. My partner tweeted about this to BA and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone's pics at the same time. By then the so-called priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone. When I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her time. The 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights (they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the A380). The flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours, 59 minutes, and without delay on either end. We had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does BA have to keep doing this? Once boarded, we were – unlike the other Club Europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). She was told No; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we thought, but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening, we were joined by some rather merry Club Europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for BA use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! We showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. I am a BA Exec Silver member and paid over £2,500 return for Business flight, as had work straight after flying both journeys. The 'flat' business seat on YYZ-LHR was broken and Cabin Service Director couldn't fix it. No extra pillows available in either Business or First. I have also flown their economy plus (Montreal to London), and business class  (London-Tokyo, London-Rome return). Business is okay. I started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie were missing. In the next few days I tried to see the last part of the movie on other two BA flights (business and economy plus) and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing. ✅ Verified Review |  Return flights from Newcastle to Geneva via London Heathrow in Club Europe. BA's lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors, but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job. But the staff greeted us with a smile, the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable. We had a nice smooth flight home to Iceland at the end of our vacation and I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to my next flight with BA. ✅ Verified Review |  I was a bit nervous when I booked my Bristish Airways return flight from London - Tokyo, but I had a really pleasant experience. For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a change of aircraft configuration. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. I did not mind paying that bit extra for BA flights but now better off with EasyJet. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. I attempted to do this on BA's \"Manage My Booking\" for about 2 hours and, although I selected 4 different flight times, each time I thought my booking change was completed (at an extra cost of £156-199 + seat costs), I was told that my changed flights were fully booked, even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available (quite a few). I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Tallinn return. Good flight. The flight home was a surprise using a Qatar Airways plane and crew due to BA strike. Row 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on BA, a better seat on a new plane, a decent free snack and a nice small bottle of wine also free! ✅ Verified Review |  Stockholm to London Heathrow. Buy on board service took ages. When complaints were made to cabin crew, the response was \"they are entitled to bring hand luggage\" The trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew Accra to London Heathrow. Must be terrible working for BA now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers. However, on flight BA 2645 from Malta to Gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted. I was very disappointed and BA need to do better. For me to fly with BA again British Airways lost my luggage on the 20th June and here I am on the 30th still trying to get some information. We came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we weren't providing the correct information. We were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us, when we arrived at Heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because 'there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage, if you make a claim you need to just wait for a phone call. After countless emails, I finally received a message telling me that even though British Airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements, I should have contacted American Airlines to request it. ✅ Verified Review |  Just landed from the second of two flights in First between London and Kuala Lumpur and on both legs, the experience was exceptional. Onboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests. ✅ Verified Review | British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported \"The most delay-afflicted route. 85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer\". Indeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hour. The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. I have flown with British Airways 3 times out of Manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight. I telephoned BA customer service today to ask about the laptop situation, after pressing many buttons I was informed all the lines are busy and cut off. I will never book a flight with BA again, even if this means I have a long layover or connection time. ✅ Verified Review |  On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos to London Heathrow on BA 651. I cannot imagine flying with BA again. ✅ Verified Review |  I was flying back from Zurich to Heathrow after a visit to see my son. ✅ Verified Review |  Rome to Heathrow flight on the 23rd June delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical fault. BA support and service in Rome was non existent. BA is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus, actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better service. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. I have never written a review on anything in my life, but how can an airline like British Airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes? Apart from that, flight great, but sorry BA please admit your mistake and put this right. We were at the gate when BA cancelled our flight. Check in at Leeds was efficient. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom. Bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy. Breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created. ✅ Verified Review |  I had an early morning flight from London Heathrow to Dublin to attend a memorial service in Ireland. I saw an elderly Chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in BA uniform walked away and ignored them. ✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Luxembourg via London. The Bangkok to London route is served by B777 aircraft that look like they've seen better days. Service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg, with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline. een a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year We have been through ash clouds, strikes, IT breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I am now cofused why I should ever fly British Airways vs Low Cost Airlines. But waited on arrival for over 30mins - non priority bags came out mixed with priority - British Airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it's losing its edge as a world reknowned airline. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways charges a big premium for Premium Economy. I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. ✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to London. The service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers. ✅ Verified Review |  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by \"Mixed Fleet\". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The crew on this flight were great. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok  journey. The aircraft was there, still boarding, my bag was checked-in for my final destination but I wasn't! They forgot to check me in for my full journey at departure. Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe should be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. Bye BA. BA lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available. Boarding on time, cabin crew in Club Europe were very pleasant and efficient as I always find with BA. There are no substantial differences to the service offered by a low-cost airline: no free food/beverage, little leg space, choice of seets only for extra payment, etc. ✅ Verified Review |  Awful, cost cutting beyond belief. half empty cabin across the entire flight, ran out of alcohol too. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. My wife, my son (4) and me all flew BA Euro Club on our way to Alicante, for some reason when booking Club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer. Club Euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra, the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane, its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Antigua. BA state in their motto \"to fly, to serve\". The price of the ticket about £500 for a 2 hour flight - had no relationship to the ultra-economy service on this flight. The embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take-away to try and make up for the no-frills service. Again as too often with British Airways nowadays, flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem. Since our late arrival was known by BA at least 5 hours in advance why didn't they at least pre-book our connecting flight from LHR. It takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin, with some people not even getting served. BA has gone downhill, and nothing but sad customers and embarrassed cabin crew. BA certainly isn't cutting prices of flights. Ryanair and easyjet offer many similar routes with half the price as BA. I am taking my business elsewhere and only use BA to spent the avios. Just awful customer service which BA, won't care to look into. ✅ Verified Review |  I am a frequent flyer with British Airways, having held Silver membership for years. I fly this route around once every other week, but have been BA to long-haul destinations (Hong Kong, Beijing, NYC, D.C. and San Francisco) several times a year, my experience on this flight tallies with the othe ✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I were very disappointed with our British Airways flights from Sydney to London return, flying Premium economy. BA don't offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines. We would not fly with BA premium economy again, it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare. distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route - with WT+ you will receive one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks, toothbrush), one welcome drink (\"cava or water\"), one glass for drinking with the first meal, a slightly wider seat (1 inch), minor extra recline (1 inch) and a little extra legroom, as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner (I am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian, which was the traditional BA carby pasta from WT, which was fine). Caught up in the shambles of BA IT system collapse on 27th May so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day. Flight itself next day, crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty IFE. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and I would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. The IFE system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines. ✅ Verified Review | British Airways were truly awful on this flight from Heathrow to Miami. Not good. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. This delay was not BA s fault, and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the flight but hope that BA do not make any further cuts, and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day. The flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline. ✅ Verified Review |  Booked Gatwick to Lima return. ught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flight back to the UK with some trepidation. The service on BA flights really is terrible. The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. I then booked a holiday in Rome for my wife and myself and I was amazed that BA have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine. If BA wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one ❎ Unverified |  Rome to Heathrow. ✅ Verified Review | It was the fist time I traveled with British Airways and I believe it will be the last. I made more than 50 calls from November to a day before traveling to reissuing my e-ticket. After a long wait to get connected, they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e-ticket and sent it to my e-mail, for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight. I used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans-Atlantic airlines. The British Airways business class product is the worst by far. British Airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt. Our previous British Airways flight was on a Gatwick 777 - they are adding an extra 50 seats to these planes. e spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I checked online and confirmed I had two bags of allowance to check in with my premium economy seat purchased. However, when I went to the airport to check in the luggage BA insisted that I only had one bag allowance and I had to pay. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - \"Cabin crew, seats for landing\". The pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. I booked my return flights back in January when BA were having their annual sale for around £1700. there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. I'm 6'0 and found I was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. The flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. Talked to BA customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the IOM (where I live) from London City but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day. ✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to London. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Heathrow to Geneva. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There is now no reason to use BA for short haul when there is a low cost alternative. I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. They make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price doesn't match the standard of service. It didn't feel like a national carrier, felt more like budget airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that doesn't include checked baggage. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. Multiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance. Friday, May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I obtain a boarding pass on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles, however the BA desk attendant informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LA. ✅ Verified Review |  Great flight from London to Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787-9. I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. ✅ Verified Review |  Moscow Domodedovo to Houston via London Heathrow roundtrip in economy class. All the flights were full in economy, with the exception of BA195 which was 2/3 to 3/4 full. The 10-hour flight between London and Houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight. The 4-hour flight between London and Moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight. The cabin temperature on the flight from London to Moscow was too warm - I was sweating. Regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshments/snacks to be provided given this isn't a low carrier airline. the service. Inflight entertainment choice was generally good, offering something for everyone. I can't really review this flight as British Airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested I reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2 days. ✅ Verified Review |  On this route from Amsterdam to Tokyo Haneda via London Heathrow we had the expected service onboard. Their service was great. Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. Boarding was on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Called the luggage call centre 3 times. The first time the agent put a note in the system to say that I needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day. Called again to check if the luggage had left Heathrow. All the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be delivered. Contrary to how Virgin crew are on an overnight flight (serve food, dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing) BA crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything. Whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable I can recommend 24D as there is no PAX seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew Premium Economy from London to Toronto in a Boeing 787. Flight good, cabin crew pleasant, food OK-ish, though nothing special. Crew excellent, food unexpectedly good (the veggie lasagne was one of the best I've ever had), and the wine of a good quality. It appears inflight service has improved a bit in Club and the food is now edible and available. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent. As a regular flyer with BA, my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image. ✅ Verified Review |  How far BA has sunk! ✅ Verified Review |  I was very disappointed because on my flight from Athens to London (a 4 hour flight) no food or drinks were offered for free. Very very disappointed, as other European airlines provide free food and drink/snacks, even from countries such as Greece (Aegean Airlines). ✅ Verified Review |  I flew London Heathrow to Cape Town, to board the Queen Elizabeth, Cunard had included a flight via the Middle East, which at the time did not make sense, so I paid the additional £120 each to fly direct with BA, the airline I knew and trusted for 30 years. ✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel in Club Europe. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways from Rio de Janeiro to London Heathrow. Needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 0/5 stars. My 'randomly' allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights, seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats. ✅ Verified Review |  Although they indicate it's against their policies, they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow, causing a 20 min delay. For all the other connections that were missed, they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed. The departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time, it didn't really matter. We had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to £340 for my wife and I, depending where you wanted to sit. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway. Knowing the lounge from previous visits, the staff are okay, a fair range of snacks and drinks, but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilets. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient, probably due to being a quiet Saturday evening flight. ✅ Verified Review |  These are words you may not read often, but I actually enjoy the British Airways flights from London City. The staff are friendly and, for now, they still feed you and offer extra drinks. Staff are polite and friendly. As it was around 20.30 uk time, I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. Eventually the correct drink was brought. In their defence, I flew back with them from Delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff. ✅ Verified Review |  I am one of those crazy people who still (until recently) flew Edinburgh - London Heathrow weekly paying nearly £400 with British Airways as it's the key airport. ✅ Verified Review |  BA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers. They close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines. BA have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant - polite and respectful but minimum effort. Or alternatively try the competition which will soon include Norwegian Air and I can't see how Norwegians' economy class can be any worse than BA's. I booked a flight for my wife to India but before paying for it I called the BA executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable. I then had to cancel the booking and instead I booked a flight with BA to the Maldives.To my dismay I was not refunded what I expected for the fare to India. I called BA at the beginning of March to find out what had happened, They told me that they would get back to me within 30 days. Both BA flights in the morning/midday and the only flights to Heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hours. . It was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers, and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process? ✅ Verified Review |  Glasgow to Chicago via Heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to Premium economy at an extra cost. In fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight BA 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg. To make matters worse the BA customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort. To be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier ❎ Unverified |  I have always given fair reviews to any airline. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Edinburgh. BA could not even be the acronym for budget airline. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Vienna. I've never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as British Airways has recently. I can accept that I now have to pay extra if I want to check in a bag, but to sit on a 'full-service' airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water, really? Within one hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to Aberdeen. Service was OK but things are not as they were with British Airways. 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class. Instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served, the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served (because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows). The senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left! ✅ Verified Review |  Zürich to London Heathrow. ✅ Verified Review |  Dublin to London. I was told I had to order a kosher meal if I did not eat ham. However I was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight. So I ordered a kosher meal for my return flight. BA should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier. The only reason we flew British Airways was because we had a connecting flight from Heathrow with another airline. Our connecting flight from Heathrow cost £420 each and was a 14 hour flight. Yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with BA costs £220 each. Seat confort was great for economy. seat confort on this A380 seemed better than Emirates A380. You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. The 747 \"New 1st\" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its ok, but apart from a \"1st\" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. As we walked through the cabin I was reminded how cramped and daft the ying yang seats are. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class \"wing\" at LHR and after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. The Concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. n cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. Wine ok. All very pleasant and not busy for once. For once I had the meal - as it looked nice. It was a salmon salad - and I have to say it was very good indeed. My wife had a hot cheese sandwich which she said was ok. Champagne was served from the bottle, it was nice. Good food and plenty of booze. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Crew were fine - and don't like the BA cost cuts. As one said \"we spend half the flight apologising to passengers.\" They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. Seats, food and entertainment good, drinks plentiful, staff attentive and friendly. Return trip, flight crew greeted us with smiles and showed us to our seats. We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. It hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket price. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. Cramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced \"our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags\". Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. Don't pay for BA shortfall, use cheap alternatives, its the same service. Boarding was sort of a mess, as BA let frequent flyers (not flying Business) board through the Business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. Food was just ok (I still can't understand how BA can run out of entrée options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. The cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that BA have going for them. Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from London to Dubai. When I moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays, a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me. I'm really disappointed with BA. ✅ Verified Review | Stuttgart to London with British Airways. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). I like BA’s website that allows you split classes like this. All BA cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful. ✅ Verified Review |  Punta Cana to Gatwick return. I would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with BA but can find nothing. The layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up, the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. Food: On the outbound overnight flight, breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. Seat fees: I don't know of any other \"full service\" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. Just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on BA. On our return we were told checked bags would be extra, although the kindly baggage check-in attendant waived the fee for us (no doubt, he too is as much a victim of BA's indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers). My review is based on three different criteria: Service, food, and seat comfort. The flight was full, but service did not suffer. The food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible. Also, they have eliminated the second meal/snack service - all they served was tea/coffee and a cookie. ✅ Verified Review |  Stavanger to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. The trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with BA booking under AA flights from LHR to LAS via JFK. On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. ✅ Verified Review |  Copenhagen to Mexico City via London Heathrow. British Airways uses a 2-4-2 configuration with every second seat backwards. To serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat. Food is nothing special but service is polite. This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. British Airways European flights are nothing more than a no-frills airline. This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. s, there is no beverage service on short haul flights. BA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. I landed in London at 1:15 P.M. This flight did not leave until 6:30 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 3:00 flight. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. To end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process. Arrived in Nice and it was 1 hour before we foudd our Baby's buggy in another section altogether, no one informed. I called BA and they said the flight is under airport control and I have to check in at the airport. When I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily being bumped to economy. Then they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in price. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did try. Fast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined. I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. ✅ Verified Review |  A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to Boston. Excellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston. Terrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or Austrian. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. This was not my first time flying with British Airways, but it had been a long time since I last boarded a long-haul flight with them, and the trip exceeded my expectations. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. ✅ Verified Review |  The flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow was extremely uncomfortable, although the entertainment was quite good on the TVs, the food was horrible, plasticy tasting, and above all not tasty. The flight from Heathrow back to JFK had many delays, although this was out of anyone's control, it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane (5 hours). While upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to Oman. On arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. They flatly refused to change the flight so I had to buy a ticket in the only available class - World Traveller Plus. Absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stick. The long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flight. However, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. I wasn't too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! This is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. The lounges at LHR T5 need work. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Business class flight from Heathrow to Singapore. During the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic Two years ago London to Dublin our bags were lost for two days. Upside - service on board BA559 was excellent. However, business class on BA Europe flight is no different to economy so don't pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat. ✅ Verified Review |  Just got off the flight from Heathrow to New Orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights I have ever had to endure. ✅ Verified Review |  We flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BA. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said \"Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest.\" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. ✅ Verified Review | Having only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. an happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. After asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. They give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. The flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar was uneventful, clean aircraft, no delays, no issues - apart from the lack of drinks / snacks. Well done BA, you've alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. The flight was meant to depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720, hardly a big deal right? I would go so far as to say that it's probably the worst flight I've been on, and I've flown Monarch and easyJet. I did e-mail BA with my concerns, but they didn't bother to reply. ✅ Verified Review | British Airways has got it wrong on short European hauls. I was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute, a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle, then of air turbulence. It has been a long time since I have been on a British Airways flight and time has not been kind. New seating and IFE but very old. ✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Gatwick to Grenada return with British Airways. Lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good, decent food and the plane was clean. iness class flights, BA then expect you to pay an additional £77 per person each way to reserve seats. I would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not, as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together. On our 13 hour night flight I discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline. BA replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a GBP25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more. Was re-booked for a flight the next day, but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy. Total additional expenses, not counting the difference between Premium Economy (which I paid for) and Economy was ~$500. proof for the above expenses, as per protocol online - no confirmation. 45 mins to talk to a human) and was told that most expenses are not refundable but I would be compensated for the remaining. After leaving the service light on for 15 minutes looking for some water, I went to the back of the plane to find 2 members of staff reading the paper. For a 13 hour flight in a Premium Economy I would have assumed it would be similar to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other bits. We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering). This is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering. For anyone flying BA, bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. in bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer. I have rebooked with Turkish Airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute, they include food, checked bag, drinks and seat selection and sometimes a Boeing 777 on this route. ately I booked my flights to Marrakech before this expereince, and I promise that would be the last time I fly with BA. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. Had to book another flight on February 2nd and book a stay at a hotel close to Athens airport. On board, flight early, nice breakfast, good CC. CC again good on board and an ok lunch. I had not flown with British Airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to Dublin from London Heathrow Terminal 5. When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to Zone E to get a Boarding pass printed by the counter staff, after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that the flight has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and I ca not fly on that flight so I will have to take the next one (from 8am flight I was moved to 11am flight). British Airways policy of offering a \"fun size\" Mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Beijing - London Heathrow, Emerald member so a one minute check-in with a dedicated counter was appreciated. The BGS Lounge which BA uses was a welcome surprise, owing to the fact that there are many Japanese food options at that time (JAL also shares the lounge). ✅ Verified Review |  Flew from London Heathrow to Geneva. On board seats arranged for benefit of British Airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers. Overall not what one expects from Business Class and negates any positive aspect of the flight. ✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to London Heathrow. BA now charges for snacks and drinks in Eurotraveller, a move that surprised me as BA is now nothing but a very expensive Ryanair or EasyJet. After arriving in London we started out with a 5 hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn Boeing 772. A couple of years ago I switched to BA from Lufthansa as I find London a more convenient transit airport, while both airlines offering the same high levels of service. Otherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of Mauritius to be advised  ✅ Verified Review |  San Diego to London, an excellent flight with really good Club World service from crew. I do not normally write reviews but I was so disappointed with the service and flights from BA for a recent 4 night stay in a Dubai with my wife, that I had to make a comment. ✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight, no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats, no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. ✅ Verified Review |  My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking. British Airways has started charging inflated prices for food, on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines, The standard is pathetic, and it is no surprise that the flight was empty. British Airways was the worst airline I have ever flown with. When I asked for a second (yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they had run out of wine also). Firstly couldn't book myself in online - my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldn't move him, his seat was fixed. I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. ❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told \"no, this is no When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again \"no, this is not possible\". After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is. ✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. I did not bother with the \"buy on board\" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, gigg I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. Flight left from the \"A\" terminal and we boarded \"downstairs\" from the lounge. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. I read the BA \"Brochure\" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. ✅ Verified Review |  Overnight flight from St Lucia to Gatwick. The food options on this flight were not of the usual standard I would expect of business class. Overall a good flight. Full flight. Flight left and arrived on time. ✅ Verified Review |  I am due to fly from Tehran to Vancouver via London Heathrow. British Airways customer service is the worst airline customer service I've seen. I would be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with British Airways. She had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip. I am a business travelled and would prefer to fly Club Europe but I am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. \"We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline\" - \"But BA did all the booking!\". Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. (the last time I flew BA). ✅ Verified Review |  I have flown a lot with British Airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed at BA's bad reviews. ✅ Verified Review |  Phoenix to London Heathrow. We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). ✅ Verified Review |  San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. ✅ Verified Review |  Amman to London Heathrow. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Miami. You get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want, and it is good value on a ten hour flight. Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. I decided to give British Airways a chance for a short weekend trip to London, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlines. A plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. I really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I would be happy to get back to those days. ✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to London Heathrow. Can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 3.5-hour flight from Istanbul to London. British Airways First Class seat is barely a Business Class seat on other airlines. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok. As you walk into Heathrow T5 you have the feeling of a world class airline - and that's where it stopped! The interior on the seating was old and lumpy I'm sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw! So they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any USB charge points around the plane. I didn't expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised. This was an older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration (31\" seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. Poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs. I asked for sparking wine but it's only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can't be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after take off with an ok entree. North Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. Fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. ed from the club lounge made up for it). Overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. The meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. Only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive \"upgrade\" we were sold at the beginning of the year). BA is now no better than the no frills competitors, but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices. The flight was on time and staff were professional and friendly. My first time with the new buy onboard service. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. ✅ Verified Review |  This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Vancouver return.Both flights were punctual but sadly the 747-400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age, especially compared to the A380s BA have used on this route. ✅ Verified Review |  Return trip from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow. ✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to London with British Airways. For a change, we decided to fly BA to London from Thailand for our 12 hour journey. ✅ Verified Review | London to Hong Kong with British Airways. The flight is go od as I booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying BA to get this best seat 16K, other seats are below standard for long haul business. I fly this route many times on BA rather than CX: CX is better but BA better priced, and that is, if you get the best seat. ✅ Verified Review | Flying British Airways from Paris to London is less convenient as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located one floor down at basement, but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the Cathay Pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengers. The pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time, so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection, but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate car. Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was also delayed. I therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service. The planes were clean and nice ✅ Verified Review | My partner and I flew Dublin to Seattle via London Heathrow with British Airways. Heathrow to Seattle was on a B777-200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped, making it impossible to sleep on a 9-10hr flight. wasn't possible and we weren't able to select our seats as our booking had an Iberia flight number even though it was operated by BA. ✅ Verified Review |  The whole experience was poor flying from London Heathrow to Athens. ✅ Verified Review |  Doha to London Heathrow. I don't know what timezone \"lunch\" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. Having flown BA on this route from Orlando to London Heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill. To which the cabin manager replied 'well thats just the way the industry is going, people want value for money and this is how you get it, all the airlines are doing it, if you don't like it tough'. Other airlines namely Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, even American, in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money, you even still get snacks on long haul flights! On 12/31/16 at 5pm the night before my flight, I received an email saying that my first leg to London had been cancelled and I needed to call to reschedule. On the phone, the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day I could take on the 31st. He said no and I asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights. I asked for a manager he said there were none available. I contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldn't do anything for me. If ever I had a choice between them and another airline I chose British Airways, but no more. This was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere - clearly that is not BA's fault, but it is their fault that I couldn't then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane. The onboard service continues to decline for passengers in BA World Traveller - terrible food, minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine. It's not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines, but sadly I booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. On complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund. On returning back to the UK on Christmas Eve I contacted Customer Service and was told I would receive a refund (I took the Customer Services Operators name and ID number) - no refund. I chased Customer Services again and was told the Refund Department is so busy. ✅ Verified Review |  My mother who is 79 years old who is not too well and myself, booked business class tickets on BA676 to Istanbul on 7th Jan 2017 and requested disabled person assistance for my Mother. The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood,  but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snow. We nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - I had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got stranded. We went to what was marked as Luggage Desk (Club Word), were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled. A good flight. Food is good for a short-haul flight in business class, but I note that there is no longer free snack and drink in Economy. ❎ Unverified |  Gatwick to Salzburg return in business class, and these were pleasant flights, with both flights arriving early. I have just started flying again with British Airways and, just recently, the Bordeaux to Gatwick route, once served by a 737-400 and now replaced by the more modern A320. Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional). But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. I am concerned, though, to read the generally appalling comments about BA's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight, in economy! British Airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a well-marketed and poorly executed scheme of M& S Tie-up on catering in European and Domestic routes. My first time experiencing British Airways buy-on-board service. The brand is now cheapened, the offering before wasn't gourmet, but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit, now you can't even get hot water for free. The positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly , but I do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them. My first long haul flight with British Airways. ✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? Allocated seats together (2 passengers) given at online check in, with no need to change these. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen I've  Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galley. Late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which British Airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a 4 hour line to rebook. ✅ Verified Review |  Zurich to London Heathrow, and my first trip on BA since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellers. ✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Barcelona return, and just dreadful pretty much sums up this British Airways business class experience. Since BA moved to Gatwick south terminal, their new lounge is still not ready. The flight was on time, but British Airways has slipped to low budget airline standards. I've been using BA for many years, but my next holiday is booked on another airline. ✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Barcelona return via London (premium economy transatlantic, economy on short haul). Comfortable flights and first-rate cabin service both ways. Concerning the M&S food and drink service on European sectors, I don't normally eat on short-hauls, but I did note that one of the drinks on offer in this service is my favourite ale, Old Speckled Hen, not previously seen by me on an airline (I paid with Avios). ✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from London Gatwick to Bridge Town. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced \"here is your vegetable lasagne\" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. Because of fog in morning at Heathrow I have called BA and checked online for delays of my late afternoon flight. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. Very good experience both flights. Mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficiently. My review is primarily on BA Euro Traveller in economy. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. ng as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them. BA ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and I have vowed to never fly with BA. The first disappointment came after pre-booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying, we would get a Club World meal instead. SFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants. They had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep. Great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service. These attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours - this on a night flight. Why can BA not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service? I've checked the Recommend box - but if you are on a night flight with the new contract crew, avoid them ✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Heathrow to Larnaca return. We can only choose food and drink from a Marks and Spencer's booklet, believe me the food is not up to M&S quality, they should never have put their good name behind this BA endeavour to cut costs. The crew were smiley, the food offered was okay (before BA discontinued free food and drinks in 2017), and the fl ✅ Verified Review |  We flew British Airways from Lisbon to San Jose via London. I had a middle seat, 7E, but it turned out fine, but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class. Staff on the London to San Jose flight was good but not warm or personal. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Phoenix with British Airways in Premium economy. The BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. We formally complained to British Airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future! This is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with British Airways, we will be travelling Virgin even if it means we have to get several connecting flights to our destination. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Miami to London Heathrow on 15th January and the aircraft was filthy in Economy class. There was a seat free in Business class but the Manager on the flight made it clear that he was 'not allowed' to move me. On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). We had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in London who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the London to Paris flight. After 30 minutes I showed that they were of a size allowed by BA. Won't fly BA again, except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline. I arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. ✅ Verified Review | British Airways is a very good airline. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Cape Town. Cape Town to London, the Galleries lounge at CPT spacious, but quickly became packed with pax from two flights. Push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. Overall, the flight itself was the usual BA service. ✅ Verified Review | In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”. However, if you wanted snacks (on a very long flight) you have to buy them on board, and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry. You do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight. ✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Zurich via London return, and British Airways is absolutely appalling. passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for a 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? ✅ Verified Review |  Well, I've checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport. The queue for assisted check in was far quicker – I think that things got inverted now. So I was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight. I kept checking the flight details for any planned delays - it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00. At no point did BA offer vouchers. I see no point at flying with BA (for a few years now). The communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room, only to learn they still hadn't rebooked my flight. The rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land, and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning. ✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Athens to Heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the \"norm\" for this flight with BA. I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. ✅ Verified Review | We had the \"pleasure\" of flying back to the UK on the first day of BA's fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks (a la sister company Iberia). I'm not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight I expect BA to give me a drink. BA you aren't Iberia or Air Lingus. I will avoid BA like the  plague now, sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits. This meant there was no upper deck seating. The seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. In summary the experience compared very badly to Asian or Middle Eastern airlines I've used. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - \"Why didn't you order one?\" \"I did!\" \"She didn't have a child's meal at lunch\" \"Yes, she did!\" \"Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin\" Really? And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. Customer service? Through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong  We thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight, especially since we had business class tickets. I have given my preference to BA for years in order to support my home airline. BA’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I’ve ever come across, and their corporate motto ‘To Fly To Serve’ an embarrassing joke. The only airline that takes me to London Heathrow is British Airways. I always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water. In fact I am not allowed to get any water on BA shorthaul flight unless I pay (even if I bring my own cup and tea) or unless it's medical emergency, then I could get cup of cold water for free. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Amman. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Miami with British Airways in economy class. We were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to Barbados. I was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat, a small bag of crisps or 2 small biscuits! ✅ Verified Review |  Travelled British Airways from London to Kuala Lumpur return. ✅ Verified Review |  Athens to London return. entire experience was excellent, although due to bad weather conditions in London, my original flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on another one 30 hours later. Both flights on time and the meal was average. To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight. I went to the trouble of checking in online, printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport, to be told that is not allowed! After 1 hour in the horrific queue, I am told there is \"no space for a bag drop at Manchester T3\". British Airways disgust me with this hoop-jumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet. Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios. I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The BA representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the Business Class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a Business Class seat - not the food. ✅ Verified Review |  Paris CDG to Bangkok via London Heathrow in Business Class. In business class each row has 8 seats, never seen that in a recent business class, and you can forget any privacy. 3 tiny toilets for the business class, not enough. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Hong Kong was the most disappointing business class experience. The bottom line is that BA had 8 business class seats in a row on this Boeing 777 from LHR to HKG. ✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London return in Club World on 787-900 with British Airways. I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. If only BA could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout, then there is a chance BA could return to it's former glory ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Lima. ✅ Verified Review |  On my way home on 1st January 2017 (Athens to LHR) the flight BA633 had 3 hours delayed departure. No headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  I had a fault on the lights above the seats. The seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated. A blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good. I flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features, entertainment, food and comfort. ✅ Verified Review |  Cancun to London Gatwick with British Airways. I was looking forward to my first flight with British Airways thinking that they were a leading airline. ✅ Verified Review |  Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn't have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspects. Luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection options. Onboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped this. The young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight. About 2 hours after take off food was served. Four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off. Drinks were also avaliable and free between meals. An hour before a sandwich, kitkat and a drink were served, the size was not adequate, but tasted nice. I went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly. However, it took an hour at least to serve the meal. Los Angeles to London Heathrow, and my first time flying Premium Economy with BA. Cabin crew were friendly and kind, the flight departed and arrived on time to London, very nice British Airways. He gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them. He explained we need to be onboard, ready to fly at a moment's notice, but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours. Heathrow to Cape Town on old Boeing 747-400, and even though this is still one of my favorite aircraft, the business class on was the old one. She gave her all to ensure a good flightIt is sad that legacy carriers now go the same road as low cost carriers instead of opting for better quality. ✅ Verified Review |  Baltimore Washington to London Heathrow. Extra cost for decent seat, meant nothing. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Prague. ✅ Verified Review |  This was a much better flight than our outward  The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checke ✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Copenhagen. ✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Antigua return. ✅ Verified Review |  Kiev to Belfast via London Heathrow. On the return trip, they asked me if I would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day, as my outbound plane was delayed. 'Sorry sir, the plane is now closed'. 'No sir, but the plane is closed'. 'I wouldn't debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in London are being booked out, if I were you I would jump on the internet and find accommodation'. Guess what, I am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. Food was good as was the service with very friendly cabin crew. BA were offering a good price on their Premium Economy seats so we switched. Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40 - £50 surcharge. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. The plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places. The return flight from St Lucia started well. As I entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1A a lady FA almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass - \"we have to see it,\" she said sharply, \"its a security process.\" I was startled at the aggressive tone as if I was trying to sneak on the plane. Plane left on time to the minute. There were five empty seats in 1st. Five empty seats. My wife asked for a 2nd pillow. Check in at T5 quick was able to use the fast track and Galleries North lounge due to frequent flier status, quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer. Boarding onto a new looking A320 seat 2A with an empty seat next to me, departed 10 min late but otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice. Return check in again very quick but security pretty long, used the BA lounge at EDI which is quiet with a few food and drink options, boarded throu gate 11 seat 4F on a pretty old Boeing 767 which was full. Departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late, service okay again with a snack and drink offered. flights this year in all classes and while I will continue to use BA in UK/Europe. We have not flown long haul with British Airwaves for many years. I haven't flown British Airways for around 10 years, and with work I usually fly either middle-eastern or Asian airlines, what a contrast! I doubt BA have changed anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since I last flew. Seats are so narrow - I paid extra for the emergency seat ($85!) after reading how narrow the seats were, a wise decision, but I shouldn't be paying extra as all middle-east and Asian airlines I have flown have bigger seats, better food choice, better entertainment - how can they offer such a poor service? Got to love that they do multiple rounds of drink service as Singapore Airlines never has this for a 12 hour flight or more. ✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways in premium economy, in an old tired plane. Almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room, definitely better meals and cost a lot less, so don't choose British Airways unless you are getting a good deal. No choice of meals (only veg or non veg) and the quality and quantity was extremely poor. ✅ Verified Review |  British Airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longer. By the time we arrived into London I had lost my connecting flight. We paid for the premium economy upgrade and the Flight Attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complaining. I have reached out to British Airways several times to no avail. Overall British Airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience. Having chosen the 'best seat' (this is important), I had a good flight onboard the A380 Upper deck. If on A380 with my chosen seat, this may be my preferred flight between LHR and HKG. My outbound transfer flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10). After a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised  I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. Upon arrival at Heathrow (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to find the next flights to Shanghai. When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. ine cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I've received through the years from British Airways. I am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA's regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven't flown it myself in a couple of years though), but on this and other recent showings BA's World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as well and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite. Seat became uncomfortable in the last 3 or 4 hours of the flight. ✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Heathrow, similar to the flight up with efficient boarding and impressive that a trolley service is squeezed in. On my recent long haul flight to Nairobi from London, I was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free - like some cut-rate budget short haul airline, you have to pay. It is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have, as I have always done, accepted the higher fares for better service. I was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast - while paying the same fare. Plane was half full as it was Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice relaxed flight. and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide, and when they did was just handed to me, without anything else. The BA 1st Class lounge was \"still closed\" pending refurbishment. Seats look a little \"old\" - I suspect this plane was one of the first to have the \"new\" 1st Class. This was my 5th 1st Class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. Another disappointing experience from BA - but to be honest over time you get used to a \"business class\" product in BA 1 I was asked recently why fly BA 1st Class at all. Singapore to London on the A380 was tight and IFE boxes under the seats severely restricts leg room. In economy no amenity packs, no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink services. Other 5 flights meals were just okay. I had veggie meal which was served half hour before everyone else - no drink until everyone else served. On complaining to BA Customer Services, told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra. They were also very good fun, which makes life more pleasant up in the sky. Food was good, but like other reviewers we've noticed little changes which make things not quite so special. I know this is only premium economy, but there were good standards a few years back. space to work. Catering at this 15.30 hrs departure was a plate with 3 finger sandwiches, that was it for a 2 hour and 10 minute flight in Business Class. Moving map did not work. No priority Business Class bus. I have had more legroom / seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter flight to Spain. Don't know why I had to endure such a cramped position for 12 hrs. Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status. My other half who is 6'3\" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flight. He couldn't even watch the in-flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with BA long haul ever again. On board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but I know that by January even that will have gone, thereby relegating BA to a low cost airline. Food also shows reals signs of cost reduction, and BA is very much closer to low-cost carriers than airlines like Lufthansa or Swiss. BA needs to get its act together as it will loose customers. When I asked the BA staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting £5 worth of voucher. It probably doesn't mean anything to BA, but I am not a happy customer. The only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. ith the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end. Imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can't fit in the seat. To travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it. A really good flight, left on time, crew smiled and looked like they were having fun. Flight back was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day, check in was surly but on board crew still fine. On both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and I liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passenger. Fare was cheap too, the only disappointment being that they don't have business class on domestic flights so we couldn't treat ourselves to a bit of luxury ✅ Verified Review |  London to Toronto return. Both flights departed on time and landed slightly early. ✅ Verified Review |  Chennai to London Heathrow with British Airways. Another good flight. Seats not great as usual but not so important on a relatively short flight. ✅ Verified Review | Marrakesh to London Gatwick with British Airways. The cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this w ✅ Verified Review |  It was a horrible experience while coming back from Sydney to Singapore on British Airways. As a member of their Executive Club and someone who has flown with British Airways 3 times this year I now regard them as the airline of last resort. Every BA flight I have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. From disruption in the cabin the like of which I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to delays on nearly all BA flights I have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise. ✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways. Second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving FC customers. At the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, BA should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. Their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. Unlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives first, BA is always hit and mostly miss. Finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my FC experience on BA. I let them know everything I said in this review and the last question asked is \"would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience\"? I had a nap, and then we were served a small landing snack. erent seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. ✅ Verified Review |  London to Singapore in first class was British Airways at its best. Throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly, helpful and interested as well as anticipating what I needed. British Airways staff at Delhi Airport were rude and unprofessional. Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. When we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on. When contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight. Departed on time crew provided a snack and drink on the 1 hour flight. Departed on time, seat 16B on another clean A320, crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight. Good flight, cabin clean, seats small and uncomfortable but it was economy so you pay your money and takes your chance. A very comfortable flight from London to Las Vegas with British Airways. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. Having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in Antigua at a cost of £350 to British Airways World Traveller Plus, and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals and beverages. What we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours - certainly not what I would expect from an airline such as BA. I was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complained about the service on the flight when I was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger TV screen and bigger seat - which I certainly don't think that justifies £350 upgrade fee. Food is a joke - a very small sandwich for a 3-hour flight it honestly can't get any lower (or can it?) Flight kept to schedule - ticket was quite good value and my rating is really based on the \"value\" rather than experience. The return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun. Having recently flown on Oman Air, Virgin Atlantic and Turkish Airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic. Outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped (centre seats), food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this. The World Traveller Plus area is on the upper deck and BA had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft. The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room. Overall a good quick flight and would definitely recommend BA but will stick to the 787 which I really love Flew British Airways from London to Baltimore. ✅ Verified Review |  Sofia to London Heathrow, and the flight was on time. BA now offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference is price, it's more expensive which makes poor value for money. Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. BA don't seem to get it. For whatever reason RBI cancelled one of the flights, and it was only by accident that I found this out, by going on the BA website. I would certainly never book anything direct with BA again, as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable. ✅ Verified Review |  The space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrous. This was our return journey to the U.S. as we had flown over to London on a BA B747-400 in First from DFW. According to a British Airways gate agent at Barcelona Airport, I supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave Spain. Of course, I just got married so that I have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! Excellent service overall in British Airways First. Although it was a near two-hour flight over lunchtime, there was no food offered nor could we purchase any. Very bad flight, when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up. My luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full, yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that I had in the plane, and people that I must say had bigger luggage then my own. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. Nice flight. Fast boarding, full flight but left Lisbon on time and got to London with no delays. Food on flight was nice for such a cheap flight. ✅ Verified Review |  The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? We landed on time and then had to walk miles. Another underwhelming experience with BA. ✅ Verified Review |  The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. Well done BA. ✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways, and they operate some of their oldest planes on this route so the screen is only 6\" with square lines across the screen. The food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route, only two offerings of water on the outbound flight. Usually fly this route in business class and British Airways offering is far inferior product on this route also. British Airways is a terrible airline and I will never use it again. ✅ Verified Review |  This was my first time to fly into London City Airport with British Airways. During this short flight the captain was informative and the cabin crew did a sterling job at serving drinks and snacks on a relatively short flight. ✅ Verified Review |  Scheduled to fly out of Johannesburg on BA on 27th October but due to aircraft delays (A380?) managed to get onto another flight (Boeing 747-400) to ensure I caught my connection to Charlotte from London. The seat was very uncomfortable, slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. 1 drink service instead of 2 in the old days so you better order everything you need for the whole flight. British Airways service keeps on getting worse and worse. Nice crew but slightly inexperienced and not totally familiar with aircraft type. The new first is an improvement but BA need to revaluate their offering against competion, likes of Qatar Airways, Emirates, Singapore etc, because their products and onboard service lags behind. The cabin crew service was very poor on the return flight. I waited and waited, then approached him an hour before landing. Again I waited, and just before we were ready to land I asked again, he returned with a bashed in box of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one. This is on a five hour flight. British Airways needs to take a look at the likes of Qatar Airways etc. I was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in \"Club World\" seating. I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way. Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. I'm not sure British Airways are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only as some others do. Business seat same as economy everyone now knows about, but the downgraded food - lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham, slice of Palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll. It does seem that many of the negative reviews of British Airways come from passengers travelling First or Business class. g was efficient, the seats were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate. We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. Seats were ok, but it's the standard Economy menu. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Boarding the flight at Gatwick was good, pro Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. On the return flight it was slightly different. All kind and welcoming like the first flight. Definitely would fly with them again on short haul flights through europe. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. BA part to blame for boarding the A380 so late before the scheduled departure time. On board flight down to JNB was up to scratch with a bright young mixed-feet crew and good service levels. On time arrival in JNB and then onto the morning BA (Comair) connection to CPT. Flying Comair is like flying BA in the 70's/80's with full hot service breakfast and a bit of old fashioned cabin service (endless cups of tea!). Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. ✅ Verified Review | I hadn't flown British Airways in a while but I thought I'd give them a go again. The flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements. Again, the crews are a credit to BA, they do a great a job. Cabin crew seemed approachable, but after the meal service, cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 9.5 hr flight to London. Young cabin crew dealt well with demanding passengers, drinks trolley falling over and a child who insisted on standing up in his seat for takeoff. The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient. Outward flight Kuwait to London was on a refurbished 747: flight was on time, cabin crew were hard-working, breakfast was a full British, and excellent, in-flight entertainment was AVOD, and with a wide selection of movies and a huge selection of classical tracks. Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. Overall, the flight was up to the usual standards I expect from BA: I was safe, comfortable, adequately fed and watered, and all four journeys were on time and hassle-free, with a professional set of cabin crew and clean, tidy and well-maintained aircraft. er with British Airways and PPS card with Singapore - Singapore to London leg - average - when called for service staff had a bit of an attitude like it wasn't their job so doesn't do BA any favours. Because the Vueling flight was third leg none of the check in online to Singapore on BA leg worked so I had to go to the BA desk to get checked in before dropping my bags Message to BA - I have close to a million miles on BA - I chose BA for this trip - I could have chose SQ /Star alliance - your LST couple of years focus on cost control and being cheap and not sorting out a codeshare process for both standards and your poor IT interaction that doesn't treat me as a cardholder and works just put me in the- \"will fly SQ next time I come to Europe\" bracket. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways \"Business\" class. I cannot believe that British Airways want to embarrass flight staff so much, as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served, which we were never warned about. We paid over £700 for our flight, two of us. ✅ Verified Review |  Extremely chaotic check in at MLA, with no British Airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non C class / FF members. Flight ok with warm food (chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes - also with mushroom!) and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy. Excellent and friendly cabin crew. Crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so I never got a welcome drink. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings. Another less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. When flew back to Thailand (Flight No BA009 27 Sep) at check-in member of staff advised he was unable to print of boarding pass for onward flight Bangkok to Chiangmai but assured me this was quite normal and would cause no problems. With luggage booked through to final destination I was advised by Bangkok airport that, without the second boarding pass, I would have to go landside to check in at Bangkok Airways domestic check-in. Detracted only somewhat from overall very enjoyable BA booked Vegas trip - think maybe the guy is in the wrong career. ✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Haneda to London, and British Airways is cost cutting all the time! For a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels. ✅ Verified Review |  I had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016). ✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Manchester via Heathrow. Cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. The final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives. ✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to San Francisco v Couldn't sit with my partner as unlike most \"leading carriers\", BA opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens? On the Inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane (must have been the same aircraft as the outbound). The ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn’t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway, the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey (they had to get the plane to land back at LHR just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 EUR under the EU compensation policy (the plane landed back to LHR 2hr 54 min late!). To top things off, after landing back to LHR, the ground crew from BA forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. Everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in - the answer from BA customer relations was 15,000 Avios Points! It seems the the one aim of BA cabin crew is to provide minimum service as fast as possible to maximise the time available to gossip in the galley. First time flown with British Airways and the last. Service was slow, IFE is poor to say the least compared to other airlines, and to be honest the last time will use them. My wife and I have been flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced \"cabin crew to seats for landing\". The meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. Called for help and was told it was not possible for them to do it over the phone. Called airline again and was told that it could only be done by airport staff. I haven't flown British Airways for quite a while but this journey to Nice drew home to me that BA is no longer the premier airline I thought it to be. le in economy isn't great on a 1 hour 40 minute flight. Don't get me wrong the flight and airline was okay but no different than the other lower cost airlines, when comparing ticket prices BA no longer has the edge for me. Return flight was equally poor. The only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in Kuala Lumpur, thanks to Malaysia Airlines as it is their lounge and NOT British Airways . Noting other reviews its a shame people board flights hungry as their are many outlets at the airports prior to boarding, even major retailers do  The crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight. I have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to Seoul. The total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future. British Airways gave me something I wasn't expecting - probably my worst long-haul flight experience ever. Yet another abysmal flight with BA. Perhaps that's why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. All semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. I was only on the flight as part of a tour group. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA management (although the cabin staff did their very best). We have travelled British Airways Europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we won't have to travel British Airways unless they pull up their socks. Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps. We recently flew British Airways business class from Calgary to Rome via London and returned the same route. Although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal! Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! e put my cabin bag in the overhead locker (the bag was not oversized, but I have a bad back at present, and I asked him very politely) - yet he outright refused though he helped other people. I avoid British Airways if I can, but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs. During that time BA didn't give us any food or drink, and gave us no updates as to what was happening. Return journey at Malaga, another one hour delay. On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble. Get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable. On a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professional. The Aircraft at B777-200 well past its sell by date. It really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. The plane was clearly dated - judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust here and there - but the plane was clean, the crew were extremely nice and polite. I really think it is not nice, given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal. The crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given was just fine for such a short flight. A younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly, offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a desert (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate). Onboard one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. One drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew (at around 10p a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with clearly embarrassed crew (again). BA are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking because you've cut the service back so much in the first place. begin walking down, actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. On long transatlantic flights, cabin stewards disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flight. ✅ Verified Review |  We frequently use British Airways morning flight from Boston to London, and will again, but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling. I asked the staff, and at least they found my hand luggage. Shame they don't fly to South Africa, although, if they did, it would be impossible to book a seat, as everyone would choose to fly with them and not British Airways. Sandwich on the outbound flight was good with plenty of drinks on this short flight. Service good on both flights. I only booked a week before flight. I will never fly direct to Mauritius with British Airways. a indirect flight, but thanks BA for letting me realise paying more doesn't equate to better service. Paris was a share with Cathay, and London's Terminal 5 lounge was excellent. Huge queues at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance. It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London. This happened 2 weeks ago when flying from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Firstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to \"choose\" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. We usually fly Etihad from Australia to LHR but this time decided to try BA. Never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow. The A380 is clearly the benchmark in long haul First Class flight and on this occasion BA provided a high quality service. The seats were uncomfortable. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normal It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. We were delighted with the service from Qantas (BA flys out of SYD) in Melbourne in booking our bags through to Singapore. Early morning flight to Amsterdam from London. Full served and cabin cleared in the 50 minutes the flight lasted. The cabin was crying out for a refurbishment but otherwise a good flight. My only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in Premium Economy. Both flights on time. While the seats are comfortable, the cabin modern, and the cabin crew professional, the service has really been minimized. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The quality of food in the lounge is average, thou The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. I dislike their business class seat layout. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast. First the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. On our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again  Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that's it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. I will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late.\n"
